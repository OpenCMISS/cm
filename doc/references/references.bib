    abstract = {This paper is motivated by the modeling of blood flows through the beating myocardium, namely cardiac perfusion. As in other works, perfusion is modeled here as a flow through a poroelastic medium. The main contribution of this study is the derivation of a general poroelastic model valid for a nearly incompressible medium which experiences finite deformations. A numerical procedure is proposed to iteratively solve the porous flow and the nonlinear poroviscoelastic problems. Three-dimensional numerical experiments are presented to illustrate the model. The first test cases consist of typical poroelastic configurations: swelling and complete drainage. Finally, a simulation of cardiac perfusion is presented in an idealized left ventricle embedded with active fibers. Results show the complex temporal and spatial interactions of the muscle and blood, reproducing several key phenomena observed in cardiac perfusion.},

The second edition includes a new section on preconditioning for {EBE-GMRES} and a complete revision of the section on flow field-dependent variation methods, which demonstrates more detailed computational processes and includes additional example problems. Homework examples facilitate students and practitioners intending to develop a large-scale computer code"-- {"The} development of modern computational fluid dynamics {(CFD)} began with the advent of the digital computer in the early 1950s. Finite difference methods {(FDM)} and finite element methods {(FEM)}, which are the basic tools used in the solution of partial differential equations in general and {CFD} in particular, have different origins. In 1910, at the Royal Society of London, Richardson presented a paper on the first {FDM} solution for the stress analysis of a masonry dam. In contrast, the first {FEM} work was published in the Aeronautical Science Journal by Turner, Clough, Martin, and Topp for applications to aircraft stress analysis in 1956. Since then, both methods have been developed extensively in fluid dynamics"--},

	abstract = {The sixth editions of these seminal books deliver the most up to date and
comprehensive reference yet on the finite element method for all engineers and
mathematicians. Renowned for their scope, range and authority, the new
editions have been significantly developed in terms of both contents and
scope. Each book is now complete in its own right and provides self-contained
reference; used together they provide a formidable resource covering the
theory and the application of the universally used FEM. Written by the leading
professors in their fields, the three books cover the basis of the method, its
application to solid mechanics and to fluid dynamics.


* This is THE classic finite element method set, by two the subject's leading
authors

* FEM is a constantly developing subject, and any professional or student of
engineering involved in understanding the computational modelling of physical
systems will inevitably use the techniques in these books

* Fully up-to-date; ideal for teaching and reference},
