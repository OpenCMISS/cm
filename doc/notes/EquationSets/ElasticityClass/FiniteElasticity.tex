 
\subsection{Finite Elasticity}

Formulation of finite element equations for finite elasticity (large deformation mechanics) implemented in OpenCMISS is based on the 
\textit{\textbf{principle of virtual work}}. The finite element model consists of a set of non-linear algebraic equations. Non-linearity of 
equations stems from non-linear stress-strain relationship and quadratic terms present in the strain tensor. A typical problem in large deformation 
mechanics involves determination of the deformed geometry or mesh nodal parameters, from the finite element point of view, of the continuum 
from a known undeformed geometry, subject to boundary conditions and satisfying stress-strain (constitutive) relationship. 
  
The boundary conditions can be either \textit{\textbf{Dirichlet}} (displacement), \textit{\textbf{Neumann}} (force) or a combination of them, known 
as the mixed boundary conditions. Displacement boundary conditions are generally nodal based. However, force boundary conditions can take 
any of the following forms or a combination of them - nodal-based, distributed load (e.g. pressure) or force acting at a discrete point 
on the boundary. In the latter two forms, the equivalent nodal forces are determined using the \textit{\textbf{method of work equivalence}} 
\cite{hutton:2004} and the forces so obtained will then be added to the right hand side or the residual vector of the linear equation system.  

There are a numerous ways of describing the mechanical characteristics of deformable materials in large deformation mechanics or finite elasticity
analyses. A predominantly used form for representing constitutive properties is a strain energy density function. This model gives the energy 
required to deform a unit volume (hence energy density) of the deformable continuum as a function of Green-Lagrange strain tensor components or its 
derived variables such as invariants or principal stretches. A material that has a strain energy density function is known as a 
\textit{\textbf{hyperelastic}} or \textit{\textbf{Green-elastic material}}. 

The deformed equilibrium state should also give the minimum total elastic potential energy. One can therefore formulate finite element equations 
using the \textit{\textbf{Variational method}} approach where an extremum of a functional (in this case total strain energy) is determined to 
obtain mesh nodal parameters of the deformed continuum. It is also possible to derive the finite element equations starting from the governing
equilibrium equations known as Cauchy equation of motion. The weak form of the governing equations is obtained by multiplying them with suitable
weighting functions and integrating over the domain (method of weighted residuals). If interpolation or shape functions are used as weighting 
functions, then the method is called the Galerkin finite element method. All three approaches (virtual work, variational method and 
Galerkin formulation) result in the same finite element equations.     

In the following sections the derivation of kinematic relationships of deformation, energy conjugacy, constitutive relationships and final form 
the finite element equations using the virtual work approach will be discussed in detail.

\subsubsection{Kinematics of Deformation}
In order to track the deformation of an infinitesimal length at a particle of the continuum, two coordinates systems are defined. An arbitrary
orthogonal spatial coordinate system, which is fixed in space and a material coordinate system which is attached to the continuum and deforms 
with the continuum. The material coordinate system, in general, is a curvi-linear coordinate system but must have mutually orthogonal axes at the
undeformed state. However, in the deformed state, these axes are no longer orthogonal as they deform with the continuum (fig 1). In addition
to these coordinate systems, there exist finite element coordinate systems (one for each element) as well. These coordinates are normalised and 
vary from 0.0 to 1.0. The following notations are used to represent various coordinate systems and coordinates of a particle of the continuum.\\

\noindent $Y_{1}$-$Y_{2}$-$Y_{3}$ - fixed spatial coordinate system axes - orthogonal\\
$N_{1}$-$N_{2}$-$N_{3}$ - deforming material coordinate system axes  - orthogonal in the undeformed state\\
$\Xi_{1}$-$\Xi_{2}$-$\Xi_{3}$ - element coordinate system - non-orthogonal in general and deforms with continuum\\

\noindent $x_{1}$-$x_{2}$-$x_{3}$ [$\vect{x}$] - spatial coordinates of a particle in the undeformed state wrt $Y_{1}$-$Y_{2}$-$Y_{3}$ CS \\
$z_{1}$-$z_{2}$-$z_{3}$ [$\vect{z}$] - spatial coordinates of the same particle in the deformed state wrt $Y_{1}$-$Y_{2}$-$Y_{3}$ CS \\ 
$\nu_{1}$-$\nu_{2}$-$\nu_{3}$ [$\vect{\nu}$] - material coordinates of the particle wrt $N_{1}$-$N_{2}$-$N_{3}$ CS (these do not change) \\
$\xi_{1}$-$\xi_{2}$-$\xi_{3}$ [$\vect{\xi}$] - element coordinates of the particle wrt $\Xi_{1}$-$\Xi_{2}$-$\Xi_{3}$ CS (these too do not change)\\

Since the directional vectors of the material coordinate system at any given point in the undeformed state is mutually orthogonal, the 
relationship between spatial $\vect{x}$ and material $\vect{\nu}$ coordinates is simply a rotation. The user must define the undeformed 
material coordinate system. Typically a nodal based interpolatable field known as fibre information (fibre, imbrication and sheet angles) 
is input to OpenCMISS. These angles define how much the \textit{\textbf{reference or default material coordinate system}} must be rotated about 
the reference material axes. The reference material coordinate system at a given point is defined as follows. The first direction $\nu_{1}$ is 
in the $\xi_{1}$ direction. The second direction, $\nu_{2}$ is in the $\xi_{1}-\xi_{2}$ plane but orthogonal to $\nu_{1}$. Finally the third 
direction $\nu_{3}$ is determined to be normal to both $\nu_{1}$ and $\nu_{2}$. Once the reference coordinate system is defined, it is then rotated 
about $\nu_{3}$ by an angle equal to the interpolated fibre value at the point in counter-clock wise direction. This will be followed by a rotation 
about new $\nu_{2}$ axis again in the counter-clock wise direction by an angle equal to the sheet value. The final rotation is performed about the 
current $\nu_{1}$ by an angle defined by interpolated sheet value. Note that before a rotation is carried out about an arbitrary axis one must first 
align(transform) the axis of rotation with one of the spatial coordinate system axes. Once the rotation is done, the rotated coordinate 
system (material) must be inverse-transformed. 

Having defined the undeformed orthogonal material coordinate system, the metric tensor $\delby{\vect{x}}{\vect{\nu}}$ can be determined. As mentioned,
the tensor $\delby{\vect{x}}{\vect{\nu}}$ contains rotation required to align material coordinate system with spatial coordinate system. This tensor
is therefore orthogonal. A similar metric tensor can be defined to relate the deformed coordinates $\vect{z}$ of the point to its material
coordinates $\vect{\nu}$. Note that the latter coordinates do not change as the continuum deforms and more importantly this tensor is not 
orthogonal as well. The metric tensor, $\delby{\vect{z}}{\vect{\nu}}$ is called the \textit{\textbf{deformation gradient tensor}} and denoted 
as $\matr{F}$.

\begin{equation}
  \matr{F}=\delby{\vect{z}}{\vect{\nu}}
  \label{eqn:deformationgradienttensor}
\end{equation}
 
It can be shown that the deformation gradient tensor contains rotation when an infinitesimal length $\vect{dr_{0}}$ in the undeformed state undergoes 
deformation. Since rotation does not contribute to any strain, it must be removed from the deformation gradient tensor. Any tensor can be decomposed 
into an orthogonal tensor and a symmetric tensor (known as polar decomposition). In other words, the same deformation can be achieved by first 
rotating $\vect{dr}$ and then stretching (shearing and scaling) or vice-verse. Thus, the deformation gradient tensor can be given by,

\begin{equation}
  \matr{F}=\delby{\vect{z}}{\vect{\nu}}=\matr{R}\matr{U}=\matr{V}\matr{R_{1}}
  \label{eqn:polardecomposition}
\end{equation}
 
The rotation present in the deformation gradient tensor can be removed either by right or left multiplication of $\matr{F}$. The resulting tensors 
lead to different strain measures. The right Cauchy deformation tensor $\matr{C}$ is obtained from,

\begin{equation}
  \matr{C}=\transpose{[\matr{R}\matr{U}]}[\matr{R}\matr{U}]=\transpose{\matr{U}}\transpose{\matr{R}}\matr{R}\matr{U}=\transpose{\matr{U}}\matr{U}
  \label{eqn:rightcauchy}
\end{equation}

Similarly the left Cauchy deformation tensor or the Finger tensor \matr{B} is obtained from the left multiplication of \matr{F},

\begin{equation}
  \matr{B}=[\matr{V}\matr{R_{1}}]\transpose{[\matr{V}\matr{R_{1}}]}=\matr{V}\matr{R_{1}}\transpose{\matr{R_{1}}}\transpose{\matr{V}}=\matr{V}\transpose{\matr{V}}
  \label{eqn:leftcauchy}
\end{equation}

\noindent Note that both $\matr{R}$ and $\matr{R_{1}}$ are orthogonal tensors and therefore satisfy the following condition,

\begin{equation}
  \transpose{\matr{R}}\matr{R}=\matr{R_{1}}\transpose{\matr{R_{1}}}=\matr{I}
  \label{eqn:orthoganality}
\end{equation}

Since there is no rotation present in both $\matr{C}$ and $\matr{B}$, they can be used to define suitable strain measures as follows,

\begin{equation}
  \matr{E}=\frac{1}{2}\pbrac{\transpose{\delby{\vect{z}}{\vect{\nu}}}\delby{\vect{z}}{\vect{\nu}}-
                       \transpose{\delby{\vect{x}}{\vect{\nu}}}\delby{\vect{x}}{\vect{\nu}}}=
	    \frac{1}{2}(\matr{C}-\matr{I})	       
  \label{eqn:greenstrain}
\end{equation}

\noindent and

\begin{equation}
  \vect{e}=\frac{1}{2}\bbrac{\pbrac{\delby{\vect{x}}{\vect{\nu}}\transpose{\delby{\vect{x}}{\vect{\nu}}}}^{-1}-
                             \pbrac{\delby{\vect{z}}{\vect{\nu}}\transpose{\delby{\vect{z}}{\vect{\nu}}}}^{-1}}=
			     \frac{1}{2}\pbrac{\matr{I}-\matr{B}^{-1}}  
  \label{eqn:almansistrain}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\matr{E}$ and $\vect{e}$ are called Green and Almansi strain tensors respectively. 
Also note that $\delby{\vect{x}}{\vect{\nu}}$ is an orthogonal tensor. \\

It is now necessary to establish a relationship between strain and displacement. Referring to figure 1, 

\begin{equation}
  \vect{z}=\vect{x}+\vect{u}
  \label{eqn:displacement}
\end{equation}

\noindent where \vect{u} is the displacement vector. \\

\noindent Differentiating \eqnref{eqn:displacement} using the chain rule,

\begin{equation}
  \delby{\vect{z}}{\vect{\nu}}=\delby{\vect{x}}{\vect{\nu}}+\delby{\vect{u}}{\vect{x}}\delby{\vect{x}}{\vect{\nu}}=
                               \pbrac{\matr{I}+\delby{\vect{u}}{\vect{x}}}\delby{\vect{x}}{\vect{\nu}}  
  \label{eqn:displacementgradient}
\end{equation}

\noindent Substituting \eqnref{eqn:displacementgradient} into \eqnref{eqn:greenstrain},

\begin{equation}
  \matr{E}=\frac{1}{2}\bbrac{\transpose{\delby{\vect{x}}{\vect{\nu}}}\transpose{\pbrac{\matr{I}+\delby{\vect{u}}{\vect{x}}}}
                  \pbrac{\matr{I}+\delby{\vect{u}}{\vect{x}}}\delby{\vect{x}}{\vect{\nu}}-\matr{I}}
  \label{eqn:greendisplacement1}
\end{equation}

\noindent Simplifying,

\begin{equation}
  \matr{E}=\frac{1}{2}\transpose{\delby{\vect{x}}{\vect{\nu}}}
           \pbrac{\delby{\vect{u}}{\vect{x}}+\transpose{\delby{\vect{u}}{\vect{x}}}+
	   \transpose{\delby{\vect{u}}{\vect{x}}}\delby{\vect{u}}{\vect{x}}}
	   \delby{\vect{x}}{\vect{\nu}}
  \label{eqn:greendisplacement2}
\end{equation}
 
As can be seen from \eqnref{eqn:greendisplacement2} the displacement gradient tensor $\delby{\vect{u}}{\vect{x}}$ is defined with respect to 
undeformed coordinates $\vect{x}$. This means that the strain tensor $\matr{E}$ has Lagrangian description and hence it is also also called 
the Green-Lagrange strain tensor. 
 
A similar derivation can be employed to establish a relationship between the Almansi and displacement gradient tensors and the final
form is given by,

\begin{equation}
  \vect{e}=\frac{1}{2}\delby{\vect{u}}{\vect{z}}+\transpose{\delby{\vect{u}}{\vect{z}}}-
	   \transpose{\delby{\vect{u}}{\vect{z}}}\delby{\vect{u}}{\vect{z}}
  \label{eqn:almansidisplacement}
\end{equation}
 
The displacement gradient tensor terms in \eqnref{eqn:almansidisplacement} are defined with respect to deformed coordinates $\vect{z}$ and
therefore the strain tensor has Eulerian description. Thus it is also known as the Almansi-Euler strain tensor.

\subsubsection{Energy Conjugacy}



\subsubsection{Constitutive models}



\subsubsection{Principle of Virtual Work}
Elastic potential energy or simply elastic energy associated with the deformation can be given by strain and its energetically conjugate stress. 
Note that the Cauchy stress and Almansi-Euler strain tensors and Second Piola-Kirchhoff (2PK) and Green-Lagrange tensors are energetically 
conjugate. Thus, the \textit{\textbf{total internal energy}} due to strain in the body at the deformed state (fig. 3.1) can be given by,
 
\begin{equation}
  W_{int}=\gint{0}{v}{(\vect{e}:\vect{\sigma})}v
  \label{eqn:totalenergy}
\end{equation}

where \vect{e} and \vect{\sigma} are Almansi strain tensor and Cauchy stress tensor respectively.  

If the deformed body is further deformed by introducing virtual displacements, then the new internal elastic energy can be given by,

\begin{equation}
  {W_{int}+\delta W_{int}}=\gint{0}{v}{[\vect{(e+\delta{e})}:\vect{\sigma}]}v
  \label{eqn:virtualtotalenergy}
\end{equation}

Deducting \eqnref{eqn:totalenergy} from \eqnref{eqn:virtualtotalenergy},

\begin{equation}
  \delta W_{int}=\gint{0}{v}{\pbrac{\vect{\delta \epsilon} : \vect{\sigma}}}v
  \label{eqn:virtualenergy}
\end{equation}

Using \eqnref{eqn:almansidisplacement} for virtual strain,

\begin{equation}
  \vect{\delta e}=\delby{\vect{\delta u}}{\vect{z}} + \transpose{\delby{\vect{\delta u}}{\vect{z}}} + 
                  \transpose{\delby{\vect{\delta u}}{\vect{z}}}\delby{\vect{\delta u}}{\vect{z}}
  \label{eqn:virtualalmansidisplacement}
\end{equation}

Since virtual displacements are infinitesimally small, quadratic terms in \eqnref{eqn:virtualalmansidisplacement} can be neglected.
The resulting strain tensor, known as small strain tensor \vect{\epsilon}, can be given as,

\begin{equation}
  \vect{\delta \epsilon}=\delby{\vect{\delta u}}{\vect{z}} + \transpose{\delby{\vect{\delta u}}{\vect{z}}} 
  \label{eqn:virtualsmalldisplacement}
\end{equation}
 
Since both $\vect{\sigma}$ and $\vect{\delta \epsilon}$ are symmetric, new vectors are defined by inserting tensor components as follows,

\begin{equation}
  \vect{\delta \epsilon}=\transpose{\sqbrac{\delta \epsilon_{11} \hspace{4 pt} \delta \epsilon_{22} \hspace{4 pt} \delta \epsilon_{33} 
                         \hspace{4 pt} 2\delta \epsilon_{12} \hspace{4 pt} 2\delta \epsilon_{23} \hspace{4 pt} 2\delta \epsilon_{13}}} :
	       	         \vect{\sigma}=\transpose{\sqbrac{\delta \sigma_{11} \hspace{4 pt} \delta \sigma_{22} \hspace{4 pt} \delta \sigma_{33} 
		         \hspace{4 pt} 2\delta \sigma_{12} \hspace{4 pt} 2\delta \sigma_{23} \hspace{4 pt} 2\delta \sigma_{13} }}	  		  
  \label{eqn:newvectors}
\end{equation} 

Substituting \eqnref{eqn:newvectors} into \eqnref{eqn:virtualenergy},

\begin{equation}
  \delta W_{int}=\gint{0}{v}{\pbrac{\transpose{\vect{\delta \epsilon}} \vect{\sigma}}}v
  \label{eqn:virtualenergy1}
\end{equation}

The strain vector $\vect{\delta \epsilon}$ can be related to displacement vector using the following equation,

\begin{equation}
  \vect{\delta \epsilon}=\matr{D} \vect{\delta u} 
  \label{eqn:virtualsmalldisplacement1}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\matr{D}$ and $\vect{u}$ are linear differential operator and displacement vector respectively and given by,

\begin{equation}
  \begin{array}{c} \matr{D} \end{array} =
  \pbrac{ \begin{array}{ccc} \delby{}{z_{1}} & 0 & 0 \\ 
                             0 & \delby{}{z_{2}} & 0 \\
			     0 & 0 & \delby{}{z_{3}} \\
			     \delby{}{z_{2}} & \delby{}{z_{1}} & 0 \\ 
			     0 & \delby{}{z_{3}} & \delby{}{z_{2}} \\ 
			     \delby{}{z_{3}} & 0 & \delby{}{z_{1}} \\ \end{array} }
  \label{eqn:differentialoperator}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  \vect{\delta u}=\transpose{\pbrac{\delta u_{1} \hspace{4 pt} \delta u_{2} \hspace{4 pt} \delta u_{3}}}
  \label{eqn:displacementvector}
\end{equation}

The virtual displacement is a finite element field and hence the value at any point can be obtained by interpolating nodal 
virtual displacements.

\begin{equation}
  \vect{\delta u}=\matr{\Phi}\matr{\Delta}
  \label{eqn:interpolation}
\end{equation}
