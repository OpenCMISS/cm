A singular-value-decomposition-based algorithm is proposed to decompose the signal into two time-orthogonal subspaces; one containing the ECG and the other containing artifacts like baseline wander and electromyogram.  The method makes use of redundancy in 12-lead ECG.  The same method is also tested for reconstruction of a completely lost channel.  The online implementation of the method is given.  It is observed that the first two decomposed channels with highest energy are sufficient to reconstruct the ST-segment and J-point.  The dimension of the signal space, on the other hand, does not exceed three.  Data from 23~patients, with duration ranging from 9~to 21~min, are used.},

  abstract  = {Three new approaches for the analysis of ventricular repolarisation in 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) are presented: the spatial and temporal variations in T-wave morphology and the wavefront direction difference between the ventricular depolarisation and repolarisation waves. The spatial variation characterises the morphology differences between standard leads. The temporal variation measures the change in interlead relationships. A minimum dimensional space, constructed by ECG singular value decomposition, is used. All descriptors are measured using the ECG vector in the constructed space and the singular vectors that define this space. None of the descriptors requires time domain measurements (e.g. the precise detection of the T-wave offset), and so the inaccuracies associated with conventional QT interval related parameters are avoided. The new descriptors are compared with the conventional measurements provided by a commercial system for an automatic evaluation of QT interval and QT dispersion in digitally recorded 12-lead ECGs. The basic comparison uses a set of 1100 normal ECGs. The short-term intrasubject reproducibility of the new descriptors is compared with that of the conventional measurements in a set of 760 ECGs recorded in 76 normal subjects and a set of 630 ECGs recorded in 63 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (ten serial recordings in each subject of both these sets). The discriminative power of the new and conventional parameters to distinguish normal and abnormal repolarisation patterns is compared using the same set. The results show that the new parameters do not correlate with the conventional QT interval-related descriptors (i.e. they assess different ECG qualities), are generally more reproducible than the conventional parameters, and lead to a more significant separation between normal and abnormal ECGs, both univariately and in multivariate regression models.},

  abstract  = {Our studies deal with fully automatic measurement of heart rate variability (HRV) in short term electrocardiograms. Presently, all existing HRV analysis programs require user intervention for ectopic beat identification, especially of supraventricular ectopic beats (SVE). This makes the HRV measurement in large, e.g. epidemiological studies problematic. In this paper, we present a fully automatic algorithm for the discrimination of the ventricular (VE) and SVE ectopic beats from the normal QRS complexes suited for a reliable HRV analysis. The QRS identification is based on the template matching method. The ectopic beats are identified based on several morphological and timing properties of the electrocardiogram (ECG) signal. The method incorporates several approaches and makes HRV analysis of large numbers of electrocardiograms feasible. It uses the template matching for the basic morphology check of the QRS complex and the P-wave, the timing information to avoid unnecessary ectopic beat checks and to adjust thresholds and it also looks for a special QRS morphology, which is common in VEs. We used a testing set of 69 electrocardiograms selected from a large number of recordings. The selected ECGs contained abnormalities including ectopic beats, right branch bundle block, respiratory arrhythmia, blocked atrial extrasystole, high amplitude and wide T-waves. The evaluation of our method showed a specificity of 0.99, supraventricular ectopic beat sensitivity of 0.99 and ventricular ectopic beat sensitivity of 0.98.},

  abstract  = {The goal of the inverse problem of electrocardiography is noninvasive discrimination and characterization of normal/abnormal cardiac electrical activity from measurements of body surface potentials. Smoothing and attenuation in the torso volume conductor cause the problem to be ill posed. Standard regularized solutions employ an a priori constraint to achieve reliability and may be biased by the constraint chosen as well as the regularization parameter used to weight it. In this paper, we describe an approach that reformulates this inverse problem as the search for a solution that is a member of an admissible solution set; admissibility is defined in terms of the available constraints. In principle, this approach can utilize as many constraints as may be available, unlike standard techniques which do not easily permit the use of multiple constraints. No regularization parameter is required; instead, we need to choose the nature and size of the constraint sets. Constraints described include several spatial constraints, weighted constraints, and temporal constraints. We describe a solution approach based on iterative convex optimization, and the algorithm--the ellipsoid algorithm--which we have used. Accuracy and feasibility of the method are illustrated with simulation results using dipole sources and measured epicardial potentials.},

  abstract  = {Electric shock is the only effective therapy against ventricular fibrillation. However, shocks are also known to cause electroporation of cell membranes. We sought to determine the impact of electroporation on ventricular conduction and defibrillation. We optically mapped electrical activity in coronary-perfused rabbit hearts during electric shocks (50 to 500 V). Electroporation was evident from transient depolarization, reduction of action potential amplitude, and upstroke dV/dt. Electroporation was voltage dependent and significantly more pronounced at the endocardium versus the epicardium, with thresholds of 229±81 versus 318±84 V, respectively (P=0.01, n=10), both being above the defibrillation threshold of 181.3±45.8 V. Epicardial electroporation was localized to a small area near the electrode, whereas endocardial electroporation was observed at the bundles and trabeculas throughout the entire endocardium. Higher-resolution imaging revealed that papillary muscles (n=10) were most affected. Electroporation and conduction block thresholds in papillary muscles were 281±64 V and 380±79 V, respectively. We observed no arrhythmia in association with electroporation. Further, preconditioning with high-energy shocks prevented reinduction of fibrillation by 50-V shocks, which were otherwise proarrhythmic. Endocardial bundles are the most susceptible to electroporation and the resulting conduction impairment. Electroporation is not associated with proarrhythmic effects and is associated with a reduction of vulnerability.},

A model of polyphasic deflections based on atrial recordings during reentrant tachycardia was used to facilitate distinction of local and distant activity by methods independent of the test variables. The performances of variables were assessed by comparing areas under receiver operating characteristic curves. Optimal thresholds of test variables were identified by maximizing statistics which corrected for the pretest probability of local activation. It was found that the greatest negative first derivative of the unipolar potential discriminated between local and distant ventricular signals, but performed less well than the ratio of the first derivative to the potential for distinguishing between local atrial signals and distant ventricular signals. A linear combination of the potential and the ratio of the first derivative and the potential performed well for all groups of signals studied. Optimal criteria for detecting local activation are discussed.},

  abstract  = {{\em Introduction:} This simulation study seeks to extend the virtual electrode polarization (VEP) theory for defibrillation to explain the success and failure of biphasic shocks. The goals of the study are to (1) provide insight into why optimal biphasic shocks have a lower voltage defibrillation threshold than monophasic shocks, (2) examine the mechanisms of biphasic shock failure and to determine whether they differ from those of monophasic shocks, and (3) study how the timing of biphasic shock delivery to a spiral wave affects voltage defibrillation threshold.\par
  {\em Methods and Results:} A spiral wave is initiated in a bidomain representation of a 2-cm × 2-cm sheet of ventricular myocardium. The model incorporates nonuniform fiber curvature, membrane kinetics suitable for high-strength shocks, and electroporation. A spatially uniform extracellular field is delivered by line electrodes. The shock establishes VEP that dictates the postshock activity in the tissue. Our results demonstrate that the second phase of biphasic shocks leaves the tissue with substantially smaller postshock excitable gap, thus eliminating the majority of the substrate for reinitiation of reentrant activity. Further, the occurrence of break excitations for weaker biphasic shocks indicates that the mechanisms for biphasic shock failure are more complex than for monophasic shocks. Biphasic voltage defibrillation thresholds range from 8 to 16 V/cm, depending on the position of the spiral wave. An increase in the amount of preshock excitable gap leads to an increase in voltage defibrillation threshold.\par
  {\em Conclusion:} This study demonstrates the importance of VEP and its interaction with preshock activity in the success and failure of biphasic defibrillation shocks.},

The array had the shape of the ventricular surface of the heart. The electrograms were processed by a computer and displayed as epicardial equipotential maps at 1-msec intervals. Isochrone maps also were drawn. Several new features of epicardial potential fields were identified: (1) a high number of breakthrough points; (2) the topography, apparent widths, velocities of the wavefronts and the related potential drop; (3) the topography of positive potential peaks in relation to the wavefronts. Fifteen to 24 breakthrough points were located on the anterior, and 10 to 13 on the posterior ventricular surface. Some were in previously described locations and many others in new locations. Specifically, 3 to 5 breakthrough points appeared close to the atrioventricular groove on the anterior right ventricle and 2 to 4 on the posterior heart aspect; these basal breakthrough points appeared when a large portion of ventricular surface was still unexcited. Due to the presence of numerous breakthrough points on the anterior and posterior aspect of the heart which had not previously been described, the spread of excitation on the ventricular surface was ``mosaic-like,'' with activation wavefronts spreading in all directions, rather than radially from the two breakthrough points, as traditionally described. The positive potential peaks which lay ahead of the expanding wavefronts moved along preferential directions which were probably related to the myocardial fiber direction.},

In the present study we tried 1) to determine whether ventricular pacing also produced multiple BKTs and wave fronts and 2) to determine whether the number and location of BKTs were, to some degree, independent of pacing site. The study mainly focused on right ventricular BKTs observed during right ventricular pacing. To test hypotheses 1 and 2 we identified many breakthrough sites during sinus rhythm in seven exposed dog hearts and then paced the heart from several BKT and non-BKT sites on the right ventricle. Epicardial potential maps and excitation time maps were obtained by using 1,124 epicardial electrodes covering the anterior right ventricle and part of the anterior left ventricle. A primary wave front spread radially for several centimeters from the pacing site, and no BKTs appeared in the areas covered by the primary wave front. In the remaining areas (secondary areas), multiple BKTs appeared; their number was close to that observed during sinus rhythm in the same areas (113 versus 115, respectively, in 12 paced beats). The majority of paced BKTs (83 out of 115, or 72%) occurred exactly at the same locations where they appeared during sinus rhythm. However, 30 right ventricular BKTs observed during sinus rhythm disappeared in the secondary areas and were replaced by approximately the same number of new BKTs. Many areas without BKTs in normal beats remained so in paced beats. We conclude that during right ventricular pacing, epicardial excitation on the right ventricle exhibits multiple BKTs whose location is partially independent of pacing site and probably reflects structural properties of the ventricular wall.},

To quantify effects of errors in pericardial-surface models we also estimated heart position, size, and orientation in each subject from ultrasonic images registered to the body-surface coordinates. Known pericardial potentials were taken from epicardial measurements made during QRS with a 90-electrode sock in an adult male undergoing cardiac surgery. Body-surface ECGs were calculated for each individual from the pericardial maps, using standard boundary-element methods. Accuracy of zero-order-Tikhonov inverse solutions was tested in 91-node pericardial and 1,026-node torso models, individualized for each subject. With 10 microv rms noise added to surface potentials, the optimal regularization constant at each instant in QRS gave a relative error of 0.44 +/- 0.03; it was 0.47 +/- 0.03 using the composite residual and smoothing operator (CRESO) technique. When calculated body-surface potentials from the first 10 subjects were placed at corresponding electrode positions on the torso of the eleventh subject, whose heart size and orientation was the mean of the other 10 subjects, relative error increased to 0.87 +/- 0.06 for optimal regularization. CRESO failed in the fixed torso model. Results demonstrate that a fixed model does not provide useful estimates of pericardial potentials, and that individualized models enhance the performance of techniques for the estimation of regularization parameters.},

  abstract  = {{\em Introduction:} It is known that highstrength shock disrupts the lipid matrix of the myocardial cell membrane and forms reversible aqueous pores across the membrane. This process is known as ``electroporation''. However, it remains unclear whether electroporation contributes to the mechanism of ventricular defibrillation. The aim of this computer simulation study was to examine the possible role of electroporation in the success of defibrillation shock.\par
  {\em Methods and Results:} Using a modified Luo-Rudy-1 model, we simulated two-dimensional myocardial tissue with a homogeneous bidomain nature and unequal anisotropy ratios. Spiral waves were induced by the S1-S2 method. Next, monophasic defibrillation shocks were delivered externally via two line electrodes. For nonelectroporating tissue, termination of ongoing fibrillation succeeded; however, new spiral waves were initiated, even with high-strength shock (24 V/cm). For electroporating tissue, high-strength shock (24 V/cm) was sufficient to extinguish ongoing fibrillation and did not initiate any new spiral waves. Weak shock (16 to 20 V/cm) also extinguished ongoing fibrillation; however, in contrast to the highstrength shock, new spiral waves were initiated. Success in defibrillation depended on the occurrence of electroporation-mediated anodal-break excitation from the physical anode and the virtual anode. Some excitation wavefronts following electrical shock used a deexcited area with recovered excitability as a pass-through point; therefore, electroporation-mediated anodal-break excitation is necessary to block out the pass-through point, resulting in successful defibrillation.\par
  {\em Conclusion:} The electroporation-mediated anodal-break excitation mechanism may play an important role in electrical defibrillation.},

  abstract  = {This paper presents a literature survey of automatic 3D surface registration techniques emphasizing the mathematical and algorithmic underpinnings of the subject. The relevance of surface registration to medical imaging is that there is much useful anatomical information in the form of collected surface points which originate from complimentary modalities and which must be reconciled. Surface registration can be roughly partitioned into three issues: choice of transformation, elaboration of surface representation and similarity criterion, and matching and global optimization. The first issue concerns the assumptions made about the nature of relationships between the two modalities, e.g. whether a rigid-body assumption applies, and if not, what type and how general a relation optimally maps one modality onto the other. The second issue determines what type of information we extract from the 3D surfaces, which typically characterizes their local or global shape, and how we organize this information into a representation of the surface which will lead to improved efficiency and robustness in the last stage. The last issue pertains to how we exploit this information to estimate the transformation which best aligns local primitives in a globally consistent manner or which maximizes a measure of the similarity in global shape of two surfaces. Within this framework, this paper discusses in detail each surface registration issue and reviews the state-of-the-art among existing techniques.},

  abstract  = {An understanding of wave front-obstacle interactions will greatly enhance our knowledge of the mechanisms involved in cardiac arrhythmias and their therapy. The goal of this computational study is to examine the interactions between wave fronts and various obstacles in a two-dimensional sheet of myocardium. The myocardium is modeled as an isotropic sheet with Luo-Rudy I membrane kinetics. An examination is conducted of wave front interactions with nonconductive and passive-tissue obstacles. Simulations were performed either in environments of reduced myocardial excitability, or with rapid stimulation via a line electrode. The shape of the obstacles and their ability to withdraw current from the active tissue greatly influence wave front-obstacle interactions in each of these environments. The likelihood of wave front detachment from an obstacle corner increases as the curvature of the obstacle corner is increased. A passive-tissue obstacle promotes wave front-obstacle separation in regions of depressed excitability. Under rapid pacing, the presence of the passive obstacle results in wave fragmentation, while the insulator obstacle promotes wave front detachment. The results of this study reveal the importance of obstacle composition and geometry in wave front interactions with cardiac obstacles.},

A uniform long, straight peripheral axon is activated by the gradient of the electric field that is oriented parallel to the fiber axis. Cortical neurons in the brain are excited when the electric field, which is applied along the axon-dendrite axis, reaches a particular threshold value. Cardiac tissue is thought to be depolarized in a uniform electric field by the curved trajectories of its fiber tracts. The bidomain model provides a coherent conceptual framework for analyzing and understanding these apparently disparate phenomena. Concepts such as the activating function and virtual anode and cathode, as well as anode and cathode break and make stimulation, are presented to help explain these excitation events in a unified manner. This modeling approach can also be used to describe the response of excitable tissues to electric fields that arise from charge redistribution (electrical stimulation) and from time-varying magnetic fields (magnetic stimulation) in a self-consistent manner. It has also proved useful to predict the behavior of excitable tissues, to test hypotheses about possible excitation mechanisms, to design novel electrophysiological experiments, and to interpret their findings.},

These descriptions may take the form of computational models which then must be incorporated into the comprehensive database of knowledge of microcirculatory physiology being developed under the title, The Microcirculation Physiome Project. Toward this end we present a simple and efficient computational method for simulating transport (advection, permeation, diffusion) in tissues containing microvascular structures of arbitrary complexity. The method is convenient because transport is simulated on a regular Cartesian lattice, and efficient because features of the anatomy are resolved within individual volume elements of the lattice. As a result, relatively low-resolution lattices yield accurate results. Therefore the method provides a feasible approach for studying a general class of transport problems in the context of realistic representations of vascular anatomy},

Regularization with the composite-residual-smoothing-operator (CRESO) parameter increased the RE slightly to 0.47. With 10% additive noise, 10 mm overestimation of heart radius, and a 10 mm error in heart position, the average CRESO parameter from 1 to 100 Hz gave an average RE of 0.71. Performance was frequency dependent. The smallest REs occurred at low frequencies. With 1% noise, optimal regularization gave average REs of 0.20, 0.40, and 0.53 in the 1-15, 15-46, and 46-100 Hz bands, respectively. Direct inference of spectral magnitudes was more accurate than Fourier transformation of inferred time-domain waveforms. Results suggest that when heart size and location are not known, minimum REs in spectral estimates are found using an overestimated heart size and a regularization parameter which is the average value over the frequency band of interest.},

The authors examined body surface map data in 76 patients with acute anterior wall MI to clarify this relationship. The patients had no evidence of previous MI, no subsequent MI, and did not receive thrombolytic therapy or other acute interventions. Maps were recorded on admission to the hospital, every 24 hours during the hospital stay, and again at follow-up examinations 6-48 months after the index MI. The region of ST-segment elevation on the initial body surface map was compared to the region of developed voltage loss in the QRS complex as measured by the integral 0-30, 0-40, 0-80, and 30-80 ms body surface maps subsequently recorded 24 hours, 48 hours, and over 6 months after the initial body surface map. There was a relationship between the position of the ST-segment elevation and the loss of the QRS segment voltages, which was pronounced early after acute MI and diminished months after the MI. The region of ST-segment elevation in the initial body surface map predicts the QRS loss. In the integral QRS$_{0-30}$ map versus the initial ST-segment map the mean correlation coefficient was -0.54 +/- 0.33 with a median value of -0.67. The integral QRS$_{0-40}$ map and ST-segment map had a mean correlation coefficient of 0.60 +/- 0.29 and median of 0.66. The mean correlation coefficient is less for the integral QRS$_{0-80}$ map and nonexistent in the integral QRS$_{30-80}$ map. This method may be useful for monitoring acute interventions in acute MI.},

During left ventricular basal or apical pacing, PA was mapped with a row of four to eight multipolar electrodes placed in the left ventricular wall to record Purkinje and muscle potentials. PA times increased linearly with distance from the pacing site (r = 0.8, slope 1.8 +/- 0.15 mm/ms, P < 0.05). With a single premature stimulus (S2) delivered from the apical or basal site, delay of PA times was first evident at remote sites (>= 50 mm) with S1-S2 = 185 +/- 5 (SD) ms, while at peripacing sites (<= 10 mm), delay was first evident when S1-S2 = 176 +/- 6 ms (Purkinje relative refractory period; P < 0.05). With S2,...S5 such that S1-S2 = S2-S3, and so on, an alternating mode of conduction, both temporally and spatially, occurred. The alternation was due to refractoriness and conduction interactions. With short premature intervals, remote coupling intervals were 30 ms less than the premature intervals. Conduction delay in Purkinje fibers with premature stimuli allowed remote epicardium to be activated by alternate routes. Conduction of constant-rate stimuli in the Purkinje system is relatively uniform. With single premature stimuli, conduction is delayed first remotely from the pacing site, whether apical or basal stimulation was employed. When S1-S2 is less than Purkinje relative refractory period, the usual endocardial-to-epicardial activation sequence is altered. Multiple premature stimuli cause remote coupling intervals to alternate.},

In addition, problems with baseline drift, motion artifacts and muscular noise are minimised. The performance of the algorithm was tested using standard ECG waveform records from the MIT-BITH Arrhythmia database. An average detection rate of 99.87%, a sensitivity (Se) of 99.94% and a positive prediction (+P) of 99.93% have been achieved against study records from the MIT-BITH Arrhythmia database.

The location of the accessory pathway was determined by multicather electrophysiologic study or surgical ablation of the accessory pathway. When fusion was minimized and ventricular activation primarily controlled by a single accessory pathway, the distribution of positive and negative potentials on the anterior and posterior torso during QRS (observed at 40 msec) and the ST segment were an excellent index of the location of the site of the accessory pathway. The relationship between a specific sequence of QRS-T wave body surface maps and a specific preexcitation site was similar from patient to patient in the presence of marked differences in age, size, and different cardiac status due to structural congenital cardiac defects. The localization of the site of the accessory pathway using distributions too early in QRS (before 40 msec) was unreliable because the early distributions varied from patient to patient for the same preexcitation site; however, the potential distributions during the ST segment were both stable and consistent from patient to patient for the same preexcitation site. The presence of significant fusion of ventricular activation initiated via a single accessory pathway and the normal conduction system or via multiple accessory pathways complicated the interpretation of body surface distributions. Thus, one can predict accurately at least seven preexcitation sites by the combined use of QRS and ST-segment body surface maps.},

  abstract  = {Multiple electrode mapping of the ventricles during complex tachyarrhythmias has revealed focal subendocardial activation whose mechanism remains unexplained. We hypothesized that reentry involving the Purkinje-muscle junctions (PMJs) may be a mechanism for such focal excitations. We have constructed an anatomically appropriate computerized 3-dimensional model of the mammalian ventricles that includes the Purkinje conduction system and 214 PMJs distributed throughout the endocardium. Isochronal maps during normal excitation, as well as during right or left bundle branch block, resembled experimental measurements and compared well with isochronal maps of propagation in the human heart. Activity observed at both sides of a PMJ in the model showed that propagation from Purkinje fibers to muscle was slower than in the opposite direction. Under these realistic and normal conditions, the evolution of reentrant activity involving muscle and the Purkinje network was simulated. The reentry pattern was independent of the initiation site. It evolved with drifting epicardial breakthroughs and transformed on the endocardium from focal activity to figure-of-8 reentry. In addition, the ECG amplitude undulated during the evolution, and decrease in the cycle period, apparent wavelength, and propagation velocity were observed. Finally, the reentry was terminated if the Purkinje system was disconnected from the muscle before it reached a relative steady state. The simulation results suggest the following: (1) Epicardial breakthroughs and endocardial focal activity may originate at the PMJs. (2) The ECG amplitude may decrease as the reentry stabilizes and the excitation wavelength decreases. (3) The Purkinje system may have a double role in the evolution of reentry: first, it is essential to the reentry at the initial stage; second, it may lead to the establishment of intramyocardial reentry, at which time the Purkinje system becomes irrelevant.},

  abstract  = {Scroll waves of electrical excitation in heart tissue are implicated in the development of lethal cardiac arrhythmias. Here we study the relation between the geometry of myocardial fibers and the equilibrium shape of a scroll wave filament. Our theory accommodates a wide class of myocardial models with spatially varying diffusivity tensor, adjusted to fit fiber geometry. We analytically predict the exact equilibrium shapes of the filaments. The major conclusion is that the filament shape is a compromise between a straight line and full alignment with the fibers. The degree of alignment increases with the anisotropy ratio. The results, being purely geometrical, are independent of details of ionic membrane mechanisms. Our theoretical predictions have been verified to excellent accuracy by numerically simulating the stable equilibration of a scroll filament in a model of the FitzHugh-Nagumo type.},

The method handles the full six degrees of freedom and is based on the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm, which requires only a procedure to find the closest point on a geometric entity to a given point. The ICP algorithm always converges monotonically to the nearest local minimum of a mean-square distance metric, and the rate of convergence is rapid during the first few iterations. Therefore, given an adequate set of initial rotations and translations for a particular class of objects with a certain level of 'shape complexity', one can globally minimize the mean-square distance metric over all six degrees of freedom by testing each initial registration. One important application of this method is to register sensed data from unfixtured rigid objects with an ideal geometric model, prior to shape inspection. Experimental results show the capabilities of the registration algorithm on point sets, curves, and surfaces.},

DICOM is a complete specification of the elements required to achieve a practical level of automatic interoperability between biomedical imaging computer systems--from application layer to bit-stream encoding. The Standard is being extended and expanded in modular fashion to support new applications and incorporate new technology. An interface to other Information Systems provides for shared management of patient, procedure, and results information related to images. A Conformance Statement template enables a knowledgeable user to determine if interoperability between two implementations is possible. Knowledge of DICOM's benefits and realistic understanding of its limitations enable one to use the Standard effectively as the basis for a long term implementation strategy for image management and communications systems.},

  abstract  = {{\em BACKGROUND:} Premature stimulation is used to characterize the reentrant circuit during ventricular tachycardia (VT) in patients. The goal of this study was to compare the effects of premature stimulation on functional and anatomic reentrant VT.\par
  {\em METHODS AND RESULTS:} In 18 Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts, thin layers of anisotropic left ventricular subepicardium were created by a cryoprocedure. In 8 hearts, rapid pacing induced reentry around a line of functional conduction block; in 10 hearts, reentry occurred around a fixed epicardial obstacle created by a cryoprobe. The cycle lengths (CL) of functional and anatomic VT were 110 +/- 10 and 167 +/- 17 milliseconds, respectively. During anatomic VT, the excitable gap measured 43% of the CL and premature stimuli could always reset VT (44 +/- 12 milliseconds). During early premature beats, conduction of the orthodromic wave was slightly depressed, but anatomic VT was never terminated. Reset curves at different sites in the ventricle revealed three different response types, both determined by and characterizing the spatial and temporal relation between pacing and recording sites. Premature stimulation during functional VT revealed a local excitable gap at the pacing site measuring 27% of the cycle length of VT. However, in only 3 of 8 hearts, premature stimuli could reset functional VT by 8%. In 5 VTs, advancement of the paced activation was fully compensated by prolongation of the return cycle, and VT was not reset. Due to slow conduction both toward and inside the circuit, the paced orthodromic wave lost its prematurity already within a distance of 6 to 10 mm from the pacing site.\par
  {\em CONCLUSIONS:} Both during anatomic and functional reentry, an excitable gap is present in the reentrant circuit. Three different response curves reveal the localization of the pacing and recording sites in the circuit. Anatomic VT can always be reset by premature stimuli, whereas in 5 of 8 hearts, functional VT could not be reset. In the other 3 hearts, VT could only be reset for less than 7% to 11% of the VT interval. Therefore, it seems very unlikely that clinical VT based on functional reentry can be reset.},

One aspect is the viewpoint invariance of the methods. This is an important property if object recognition is the ultimate objective. The robustness of the various methods is examined. It is determined whether the parameter estimates are biased, and the sensitivity to obscuration is addressed. The latter two aspects are particularly important for fitting functions in the implicit form. A detailed description is given of a parametric reconstruction method for three-dimensional object surfaces that involves numeric grid generation techniques and variational principle formulations.

These elements preserve derivative (C1) continuity across element boundaries and permit smooth anatomically accurate surfaces to be obtained with relatively few elements. These elements are fitted to the data with a new nonlinear fitting procedure that minimizes the error in the fit while maintaining C1 continuity with nonlinear constraints. Nonlinear Sobelov smoothing is also incorporated into this fitting scheme. The structures fitted along with their corresponding root mean-squared error, number of elements used, and number of degrees of freedom (df) per variable are: epicardium (0.91 mm, 40 elements, 142 df), left lung (1.66 mm, 80 elements, 309 df), right lung (1.69 mm, 80 elements. 309 df), skeletal muscle surface (1.67 mm, 264 elements, 1,010 df), fat layer (1.79 mm, 264 elements, 1.010 df), and the skin layer (1.43 mm, 264 elements, 1,010 df). The fitted surfaces are assembled into a combined finite element/boundary element model of the torso in which the exterior surfaces of the heart and lungs are modeled with two-dimensional boundary elements and the layers of the skeletal muscle, fat, and skin are modeled with finite elements. The skeletal muscle and fat layers are modeled with bicubic Hermite linear elements and are obtained by joining the adjacent surface elements for each layer. Applications for the torso model include the forward and inverse problems of electrocardiography, defibrillation studies, radiation dosage studies, and heat transfer studies.},

The investigations are performed using a number of forward simulations with a high-order coupled finite element/boundary element torso model. This torso model contains descriptions of the epicardium, lungs, skeletal muscle (with a continuously varying fiber field) and subcutaneous fat. The number of nodes, elements and solution degrees-of-freedom used in the computational torso model are considerably smaller than previous torso models of similar complexity. The successful forward simulations in this paper hence demonstrate the use of the high-order coupled approach with realistic problems. The results of the torso simulations show that the torso inhomogeneities do affect the torso potentials but do not affect the distribution or pattern of the torso potentials. The inhomogeneities considered are found to have a varying, but important, effect on the torso potentials. The effect of the subcutaneous fat is found to be more important and the effect of the skeletal muscle is found to be less important than previous reports in the literature. The results also show that the relative geometry of the heart and torso is very important in determining the torso potential magnitudes and distributions.},

Results using the high-order method are also compared with other computational methods which have had quantitative results published for electropotential problems.

We investigate the amount of improvement to the spatial resolution afforded by the surface Laplacian by examining the spatial filters that describe the relationship between cortical current sources and the surface Laplacian. The surface Laplacian spatial filters extend into higher spatial frequencies than do raw signal spatial filters, particularly for EEG Laplacian spatial filters, indicating that substantial improvement in spatial resolution is possible. However, the response of the surface Laplacian operation to the nature and amount of noise in the raw EEG and MEG signals is of paramount importance. Spatially correlated noise, coupled with uncorrelated noise, requires additional regularization of inverse spatial filters resulting in a decrease in spatial resolution. Substantial improvements in spatial resolution may be obtained using the surface Laplacian techniques as long as correlated noise levels are small and raw signals have relatively high signal-to-noise ratios.},

The forward spatial filters are seen to be low-pass functions of spatial frequency and spatial resolution degrades in external measurements. Inverse spatial filters may be used to reconstruct cortical sources from external data, but since they are high-pass functions of spatial frequency, they must be regularized to avoid instabilities caused by noise at higher spatial frequencies. The regularization process limits the spatial resolution of source reconstructions. EEG forward spatial filters fall off at lower spatial frequencies than MEG filters; hence, there is less information available in higher spatial frequencies resulting in lower spatial resolution in inverse reconstructions. The tangential component of the magnetic field provides even higher spatial resolution than can be obtained using the radial component. An accompanying article examines the surface Laplacian for both the EEG and the MEG.},

Traditional studies typically use a monocular imaging setup, thus limiting investigation to a restricted region of tissue.  However, studies of large-scale wavefront dynamics, especially those during fibrillation and defibrillation, would benefit from visualization of the entire epicardial surface.  To solve this problem, a panoramic cardiac visualization algorithm was developed which performs the two tasks of reconstruction of the surface geometry of the heart, and representation of the panoramic fluorescence information as a texture mapping onto the geometry that was previously created.  This system permits measurement of epicardial electrodynamics over a geometrically realistic representation of the actual heart being studied.  To verify the accuracy of the algorithm, the procedure was applied to synthetic images of a patterned ball; further verification was provided by application of the algorithm to a model heart placed in the experimental setup.  Both sets of images produced mean registration image errors on the order of 2~pixels, corresponding to roughly 3~mm on the geometry.  We demonstrate the algorithm by visualizing epicardial wavefronts on an isolated, perfused rabbit heart.},

  abstract  = {Cardiac potentials recorded on the epicardium or the body surface by an array of electrodes are usually analyzed either as spatial distributions or temporal waveforms. Thus, the analysis often involves temporal descriptors (eg. max dV/dt) or spatial descriptors (eg. location of local extrema) only. The best known transform technique that has been applied to these data that combines both spatial and temporal characteristics is the Karhunen-Loeve transform, a global transform applied to temporal and/or spatial bases obtained by statistical analysis of a database. As an alternative, multiresolution decompositions and related wavelet-type transforms have recently seen great development in signal processing and related fields. They offer flexibility, employing transformations onto local (rather than global) and fixed (rather than data-dependent) databases, and allow transformation of distributions, waveforms, or both, as desired. The utility of this method as applied to temporal and spatial segmentation and analysis of map data from both epicardial plaques and body surface potentials recorded during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty is illustrated.},

Interrogating structures surrounding the vascular conduit is the subject of this feasibility study using a novel underblood, phased array ultrasound-tipped catheter. {\em METHODS:} An intravascular catheter (10-F, 3.2-mm-diameter, four-way articulation) tipped with a 5.5- to 10-MHz frequency agile, vector phased array transducer with full Doppler capability (Sequoia, Acuson) was used. The imaging transducer has a wide range of tissue penetration (2 mm to >10 cm from the lens). The catheter was introduced via an 11-Fr femoral venous sheath into the inferior and superior vena cavae and right heart chambers. As the catheter was advanced, attention was directed to visualization of structures surrounding the vessel in which the catheter resided. {\em RESULTS:} From the cavae and femoral vein the thoracic, abdominal and femoral arteries could be easily imaged. Anatomy that was visualized included the liver, hepatic veins, gallbladder, and mesenteric vessels. Normal and pathological anatomy and Doppler physiology could be readily appreciated. Doppler (i.e., pulsed- and continuous-wave, color flow, and tissue Doppler) fostered unique transvascular physiological hemodynamic and flow assessment. {\em CONCLUSION:} Transvascular imaging is feasible in human subjects using this 10-Fr catheter tipped with a 5.5- to 10-MHz vector phased array transducer. Intravascular navigation to a desired location within the body and the performance of diagnostic or therapeutic procedures at a remote site under direct ultrasound visualization are possible. Full Doppler capability extends the concept of transvascular hemodynamic and physiological assessment.},

It is now feasible to obtain low-noise body surface potential maps and to incorporate accurate anatomic data into inverse procedures for the purpose of computing epicardial potential distributions. The direct verification of computed human epicardial distributions remains an important goal. The experiment reported here obtained direct measurements from six transcutaneous pacing wires that were attached to points on the epicardial surface of the human heart in an intact subject. From the same subject, a magnetic resonance scan was used to produce a specific thoracic model consisting of 5-mm cubes. The forward model uses the finite difference method to compute a forward transfer matrix that relates each of 26 epicardial regions to body surface measurements. The inverse computation was performed by zero-order Tikhonov regularization. Body surface potentials were used in the inverse procedure to compute epicardial potentials, which were then compared with direct epicardial measurements. The computed epicardial potentials were compared to the measured ones by correlation, which gave an amplitude-independent measure of similarity. Amplitude differences and time delays in computed potentials were observed, but the morphologic trend was generally well recovered. The results obtained indicate the sensitivity of the inverse model to a number of factors. The robustness of computed epicardial distributions to errors in assumed lung conductivity is shown. Results from a nonpatient-specific, but realistic, torso model are presented. The computed epicardial potentials are sensitive to the division of the epicardium into source regions, and propoosals are made concerning the choice of these regions.  This study demonstrates the use of direct epicardial measurements to assess the performance of patient-specific inverse models.},

A multiplexed data-recording system was used to simultaneously record from 64 unipolar cardiac surface electrodes during pacing at each multielectrode needle site.  The four indexes evaluated were the maximum and average gradients of activation isochrones around the site of earliest epicardial activation, the QRS area at the site of earliest epicardial activation, the interval between the QRS onset computed from all 64 epicardial surface electrograms, and the time of the minimum dV/dt in the electrogram displaying the earliest epicardial activation time (t$_{ee}$-t$_{rmso}$ interval).  Correlation coefficients between depth of stimulation and average and maximum gradients of isochrones, QRS area at the site of earliest epicardial activation, and t$_{ee}$-t$_{rmso}$ interval were 0.985 or higher.  These methods, particularly those involving gradients of isochrones, should be useful for evaluating electromaps of patients undergoing surgery for ablation of tachyarrhythmias.},

  abstract  = {Mapping of bioelectric potentials over a given surface (e.g., the torso surface, the scalp) often requires interpolation of potentials into regions of missing data. Existing interpolation methods introduce significant errors when interpolating into large regions of high potential gradients, due mostly to their incompatibility with the properties of the three-dimensional (3D) potential field. In this paper, an interpolation method, inverse-forward (IF) interpolation, was developed to be consistent with Laplace's equation that governs the 3D field in the volume conductor bounded by the mapped surface. This method is evaluated in an experimental heart-torso preparation in the context of electrocardiographic body surface potential mapping. Results demonstrate that IF interpolation is able to recreate major potential features such as a potential minimum and high potential gradients within a large region of missing data. Other commonly used interpolation methods failed to reconstruct major potential features or preserve high potential gradients. An example of IF interpolation with patient data is provided to illustrate its applicability in the actual clinical setting. Application of IF interpolation in the context of noninvasive reconstruction of epicardial potentials (the ``inverse problem'') is also examined.},

  abstract  = {{\em Background} -- Myocardial infarction and subsequent remodeling create substrates with altered electrophysiological (EP) properties that are highly arrhythmogenic. Existing ECG methods cannot always detect the existence of such substrates nor provide any detailed information about their EP characteristics. A noninvasive method with such capabilities is greatly needed for identifying patients at risk of arrhythmias and for guidance and evaluation of therapy. Recently, we developed a noninvasive ECG imaging modality that can reconstruct epicardial EP information from body surface potentials. We extended its application to hearts with structural disease and examined its ability to detect and characterize abnormal EP substrates.\par
  {\em Methods and Results} -- Epicardial potentials were recorded with a 490-electrode sock from an open-chest dog. Recordings were obtained from a normal heart and from the same heart 2 hours after left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion and ethanol injection to create an infarct. Body surface potentials were generated from these epicardial potentials in a human torso model. Realistic geometry errors and measurement noise were added to the torso data, which were then used to noninvasively reconstruct epicardial potentials and electrograms (EGMs), with excellent accuracy. EP characteristics associated with the infarct substrate were reconstructed, including (1) a negative region over the infarct, (2) EGMs with large predominant negative deflections (eg, Q-wave EGMs), (3) Q-wave EGMs with superimposed RS deflections reflecting local activation of surviving myocardium within the infarct border zone, (4) reduced magnitudes of EGM negative derivatives, and (5) negative QRS integrals of EGMs over the infarct.\par

  abstract  = {{\em Background} -- The last decade witnessed an explosion of information regarding the genetic, molecular, and mechanistic basis of heart disease. Translating this information into clinical practice requires the development of novel functional imaging modalities for diagnosis, localization, and guided intervention. A noninvasive modality for imaging cardiac arrhythmias is not yet available. Present electrocardiographic methods cannot precisely localize a ventricular tachycardia (VT) or its key reentrant circuit components. Recently, we developed a noninvasive electrocardiographic imaging modality (ECGI) that can reconstruct epicardial electrophysiological information from body surface potentials. Here, we extend its application to image reentrant arrhythmias.\par
  {\em Methods and Results} -- Epicardial potentials were recorded during VT with a 490 electrode sock during an open chest procedure in 2 dogs with 4-day-old myocardial infarctions. Body surface potentials were generated from these epicardial potentials in a human torso model. Realistic geometry errors and measurement noise were added to the torso data, which were then used to noninvasively reconstruct epicardial isochrones, electrograms, and potentials with excellent accuracy. ECGI reconstructed the reentry pathway and its key components, including (1) the central common pathway, (2) the VT exit site, (3) lines of block, and (4) regions of slow and fast conduction. This allowed for detailed characterization of the reentrant circuit morphology.\par
  {\em Conclusions} -- ECGI can noninvasively image arrhythmic activation on the epicardium during VT to identify and localize key components of the arrhythmogenic pathway that can be effective targets for antiarrhythmic intervention.},

The clinical utility of these measures has been questioned. We investigate the complex relationship between epicardial and body-surface potentials in the context of regionally abnormal myocardial repolarization.\par
  {\em Methods and Results} -- Epicardial potentials were recorded with a 224-electrode sock from an open-chest dog during control, regional epicardial warming, cooling, and adjacent warming and cooling to induce localized alterations in myocardial repolarization and regions of increased repolarization dispersion. Body-surface potentials were generated from these epicardial potentials in a human torso model. Epicardial estimates of repolarization (activation recovery intervals [ARIs] and QRST integrals) were evaluated for their ability to identify regions with increased repolarization dispersion. Body-surface QRST integrals and QTd in 12-lead ECG and 64-lead body-surface potential maps were evaluated for their ability to detect increased dispersion of myocardial repolarization. Epicardial ARI and QRST integral maps successfully located epicardial regions with increased dispersion of repolarization. The increased dispersion was not consistently reflected in the 12-lead or 64-lead ECG QTd or in the body-surface QRST integral maps.\par
  {\em Conclusions} -- This study demonstrates the inadequacy of body-surface measures that are thought to reflect myocardial dispersion of repolarization. In contrast, measures based on epicardial electrograms (ARI or epicardial QRST integral maps) provide physiologically relevant information about myocardial repolarization and can locate regions of increased dispersion.},

  abstract  = {{\em Background} -- Catheter ablation for ventricular tachycardia in healed infarction is limited to patients with inducible, tolerated arrhythmias. Strategies that would allow mapping during sinus rhythm might obviate this limitation.\par
  {\em Methods and Results} -- Two sets of experiments were performed in adult pigs to refine a new technique for left ventricular mapping. First, detailed endocardial maps were done in 5 normal pigs and 7 pigs 6 to 10 weeks after left anterior descending coronary artery infarction to characterize electrograms in normal and infarcted tissue by electroanatomic mapping (CARTO, Biosense). Electrogram recording sites were verified by intracardiac echo (ICE, 9 MHz) and grouped by location: infarct (area of akinesis by ICE), border (0.5-cm perimeter of akinetic area), and remote. Compared with remote sites, electrograms from infarct sites had smaller amplitudes (1.2±0.5 versus 5.1±2.1 mV, P<0.001), longer durations (74.2±26.3 versus 36.3±6.4 ms, P<0.001), and more frequent notched or late components. Border zone electrograms were intermediate in amplitude and duration. Second, infarct characterization by electroanatomic mapping was compared with pathological (exclusion of triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining) and ICE measurements. Infarct size by pathology correlated with the area defined by contiguous electrograms with amplitude <= 1 mV (r=0.98, P=0.0001). Infarct size by ICE imaging correlated with the area defined by contiguous electrograms with amplitude <= 2 mV (r=0.95, P=0.0016).\par
  {\em Conclusions} -- Electroanatomic mapping during sinus rhythm allows accurate 3D characterization of infarct architecture and defines the relationship of electrophysiological and anatomic abnormalities. This technique may prove useful in devising anatomically based strategies for ablation of ventricular tachycardia.},

  abstract  = {A detailed 3-D finite element model of the conductive anatomy of the human thorax has been constructed to quantitatively assess the current density distribution produced in the heart and thorax during transthoracic defibrillation.  The model is based on a series of cross-sectional CT scans and incorporates isotropic conductivities for eight tissues and an approximation of the anisotropic conductivity of skeletal muscle.  Current density distributions were determined and compared for four paddle pairs and two paddle sizes.  The authors' results show that the myocardial current density distributions resulting from a defibrillation shock were fairly uniform for the paddle pairs and sizes examined in this study.  Specific details of the spatial distribution of the current density magnitudes in the heart were found to depend on paddle placement and size.  When the minimum current necessary to defibrillate was delivered, the maximum myocardial current density produced with any of the paddle sizes and positions examined was less than four times the minimum current density necessary to render a myocyte in a fibrillating heart inexcitable, and less than 40% of the damage threshold.  These results suggest that common clinically used defibrillation paddle positions have a safety margin as large as 2.5 for current and \~{}6 for energy.},

  abstract  = {An experiment performed in London nearly 120 years ago, which by today's standards would be considered unacceptably sloppy, marked the beginning of the calcium (\ionCa) signaling saga. Sidney Ringer [Ringer, S. (1883) J. Physiol. 4, 29-43] was studying the contraction of isolated rat hearts. In earlier experiments, Ringer had suspended them in a saline medium for which he admitted to having used London tap water, which is hard: The hearts contracted beautifully. When he proceeded to replace the tap water with distilled water, he made a startling finding: The beating of the hearts became progressively weaker, and stopped altogether after about 20 min. To maintain contraction, he found it necessary to add \ionCa salts to the suspension medium. Thus, Ringer had serendipitously discovered that \ionCa, hitherto exclusively considered as a structural element, was active in a tissue that has nothing to do with bone or teeth, and performed there a completely novel function: It carried the signal that initiated heart contraction. It was a landmark observation, which should have immediately aroused wide interest. Unexpectedly, however, for decades it attracted no particular attention. Occasionally, farsighted pioneers argued forcefully for a messenger role of \ionCa, offering compelling experimental evidence. Among them, one could quote L. V. Heilbrunn [Heilbrunn, L. V. (1940) Physiol. Zool. 13, 88-94], who contracted frog muscle fibers by applying \ionCa salts to their cut ends, but not to their surfaces. Heilbrunn correctly concluded that \ionCa had diffused from the cut ends to the internal contractile elements to elicit their contraction. One could also quote K. Bailey [Bailey, K. (1942) Biochem. J. 36, 121-139], who showed that the ATPase activity of myosin was strongly activated by \ionCa (but not by Mg$^{2+}$), and concluded that the liberation of \ionCa in the neighborhood of the myosin controlled muscle contraction. Clearly, enough evidence was there, but only a handful of people had the vision to see it and to foresee its far-reaching implications. Perhaps no better example of clairvoyance can be offered than the quip by O. Loewy in 1959: ``Ja Kalzium, das ist alles!''},

No-flow ischemia caused extracellular \ionK accumulation, depolarization of EM, an increase in whole-tissue ($r_t$), external ($r_o$), and internal ($r_i$) longitudinal resistances, and failure of conduction and contraction. Muscles were reperfused 10 minutes after the onset of ischemia related cell-to-cell electrical uncoupling, ie, 26±1 minutes after arrest of perfusion. In 11 muscles, incomplete reflow occurred with only partial recovery of $[\ionK]_o$ and $r_t$. In the remaining 14 muscles, reperfusion caused a rapid and parallel decrease in $[\ionK]_o$, $r_t$, and $r_o$. When complete tissue reperfusion occurred, cell-to-cell electrical uncoupling was largely reversible. Thus, cell-to-cell electrical uncoupling did not indicate irreversible injury. Reperfusion induced a depolarizing current widening the difference between the \ionK equilibrium potential and the EM. This difference decreased after longer periods of reperfusion. Conduction was restored and conduction velocity approached preischemic values as cell-to-cell electrical interaction was reestablished and EM recovered. The recovery of $r_o$ preceded $r_i$, decreasing the ratio of the extracellular to intracellular resistance early in reperfusion, an effect predicted to influence the amplitude of the extracellular voltage field and electrocardiographic ST segments during reperfusion.},

  abstract  = {{\em Background} -- Shocks of identical strength and timing sometimes induce ventricular fibrillation (VFI) and other times do not (NoVFI). To investigate this probabilistic behavior, a shock strength near the upper limit of vulnerability, ULV$_{50}$, was delivered to yield equal numbers of VFI and NoVFI episodes.\par
  {\em Methods and Results} -- In 6 pigs, a 504-electrode sock was pulled over the ventricles. ULV$_{50}$ was determined by scanning the T wave. S$_{1}$ pacing was from the right ventricular apex. Ten S$_{2}$ shocks of approximate ULV$_{50}$ strength were delivered at the same S$_{1}$-S$_{2}$ coupling interval. Intercycle interval (ICI) and wave front conduction time (WCT) were determined for the first 5 postshock cycles. ICI and the WCT of cycle 1 were not different for VFI versus NoVFI episodes (P=0.3). Beginning at cycle 2, ICI was shorter and WCT was longer for VFI than NoVFI episodes (P<0.05).\par
  {\em Conclusions} -- The first cycle after shocks of the same strength (ULV$_{50}$) delivered at the same time has the same activation pattern regardless of shock outcome. During successive cycles, however, a progressive decrease in ICI and increase in WCT occur during VFI but not NoVFI episodes. These findings suggest shock outcome is (1) deterministic but exquisitely sensitive to differences in electrophysiological state at the time of the shock that are too small to detect or (2) probabilistic and not determined until after the first postshock cycle.},

  abstract  = {{\em Background} -- After upper-limit-of-vulnerability (ULV) shocks of the same strength and coupling interval (CI) during the T wave, (1) the epicardial activation pattern (EAP) for the first postshock cycle is indistinguishable between shocks that do (VF) and do not (NoVF) induce ventricular fibrillation (VF) and (2) >= 3 cycles in rapid succession always occur during VF but not during NoVF episodes. To study the role of these rapid cycles, rapid pacing was performed after a shock stronger than the ULV that by itself did not induce rapid cycles and VF.\par
  {\em Methods and Results} -- A 504-electrode sock was sutured to the heart in 6 pigs to map EAPs. The S$_{2}$ shock strength and S$_{1}$-S$_{2}$ CI at the ULV were determined by T-wave scanning with an up/down protocol. Ten shocks 50 to 100 V above the ULV (aULV) were delivered at the same S$_{1}$-S$_{2}$ CI to confirm that VF was not induced. Then, the postshock interval after aULV shocks was scanned with an S$_{3}$ pacing stimulus from the LV apex until the shortest S$_{2}$-S$_{3}$ CI that captured was reached. This was repeated for S$_{4}$, S$_{5}$, etc, until VF was induced. To induce VF, 3 pacing stimuli (S$_{3}$-S$_{5}$) with progressively shorter CIs were required; S$_{3}$ or S$_{3}$, S$_{4}$ never induced VF. After cycle S$_{5}$, which induced VF, 2 EAP types occurred: focal (74%) and reentrant (26%).\par
  {\em Conclusions} -- At least 3 cycles with short CIs are necessary for VF induction after aULV shocks. Cycles S$_{3}$-S$_{4}$ may create the substrate for cycle S$_{5}$ to initiate VF.},

We tested the hypothesis that subendocardial ablation at this early site would decrease the shock strength required for the ULV$_{50}$.\par
  {\em Methods and Results} -- Ten S$_{1}$ stimuli were delivered from the right ventricular apex at a 300-ms coupling interval in 5 pigs. Biphasic shocks were delivered from right ventricular-superior vena cava electrodes after the last S$_{1}$ stimulus. The ULV$_{50}$ was determined using an up/down protocol with T-wave scanning. Radiofrequency ablation was performed endocardially at the apical LV. The ULV$_{50}$ was determined again 30 minutes after ablation. To determine the importance of the ablation region, this protocol was repeated in another 5 pigs with ablation at the LV base. Delivered voltage (401±60 versus 323±50 V) and energy (11±3 versus 7±2 J) for the ULV$_{50}$ were significantly decreased after LV apex ablation by 19% and 34%, respectively. However, no difference existed in ULV$_{50}$ before and after LV base ablation. Lesions at both the LV apex and base were subendocardial and ranged from 0.8 to 1.1 cm in diameter.\par
  {\em Conclusions} -- Subendocardial ablation at the apical LV markedly decreases ULV$_{50}$, which suggests that the activation originating from this postshock early site is responsible for VF initiation and that interventions to electrically silence this site can influence the outcome of VF induction by ULV shocks.},

  {\em Methods and Results} -- In 6 isolated pig hearts, dual-camera video imaging was used to record optically from \approx 8000 sites on the anterior and posterior ventricular surfaces before and after 10 DFT50 biphasic shocks. The interval between the shock and the last ventricular fibrillation activation preceding the shock (coupling interval, CI) and the time from shock onset to 90% repolarization of the immediate postshock action potential (RT90) were determined at all sites. Of 60 shocks, 31 were SDF. The CI (59±7 versus 52±6 ms) and RT90 (108±19 versus 88±8 ms) were significantly longer for SDF than FDF episodes. Spatial dispersions of CI (36±5 versus 34±3 ms) and RT90 (40±16 versus 40±8 ms) were not significantly different for SDF versus FDF episodes. The first global activation cycle appeared focally on the left ventricular apical epicardium 78±32 ms after the shock.\par
  {\em Conclusions}-- For near-threshold shocks, defibrillation outcome correlates with the electrical state of the heart at the time of the shock and on RT. Global dispersion of RT was similar in both SDF and FDF episodes, suggesting that it is not crucial in determining defibrillation outcome after DFT50 shocks.},

To elucidate the ionic mechanisms of nonlinear $\Delta V_m$, we studied the effects of ionic channel blockers on $\Delta V_m$ in geometrically defined myocyte cultures. Experiments were carried out in cell strands with widths of 0.2 mm (narrow strands) and 0.8 mm (wide strands) produced using a technique of directed cell growth. Uniform-field shocks were applied across strands during the action potential (AP) plateau, and the distribution of shock-induced $\Delta V_m$ was measured using an optical mapping technique. Nifedipine and 4-aminopyridine were applied to inhibit the L-type calcium current (\I{Ca}) and the transient outward current (\I{to}), respectively. In control conditions, the distribution of $\Delta V_m$ across cell strands was highly asymmetrical with a large ratio of negative to positive $\Delta V_m$ ( $\Delta V^-_m$/$\Delta V^+_m$) measured at the opposite strand borders. Application of nifedipine caused a large increase of $\Delta V^+_m$ and a decrease of $\Delta V^-_m$/ $\Delta V^+_m$, indicating involvement of \I{Ca} in the asymmetrical $\Delta V_m$, likely as a result of the outward flow of \I{Ca} when $V_m$ exceeded the \I{Ca} reversal potential. $\Delta V^-_m$ decreased in the narrow strands but remained unchanged in the wide strands, indicating that the changes of $\Delta V^-_m$ were caused by electrotonic interaction with an area of depolarization. 4-Aminopyridine did not change $\Delta V^-_m$/ $\Delta V^+_m$. These results provide evidence that (1) the asymmetry of shock-induced $\Delta V_m$ during the AP plateau is due to outward flow of \I{Ca} in the depolarized portions of the strands, (2) \I{to} is not involved in the mechanism of $\Delta V_m$ asymmetry, and (3) the effects of drugs on $\Delta V_m$ are modulated by the tissue geometry.},

  abstract  = {{\em Background} Central aortic pressures and waveform convey important information about cardiovascular status, but direct measurements are invasive. Peripheral pressures can be measured noninvasively, and although they often differ substantially from central pressures, they may be mathematically transformed to approximate the latter. We tested this approach, examining intersubject and intrasubject variability and the validity of using a single averaged transformation, which would enhance its applicability.\par
  {\em Methods and Results} Invasive central aortic pressure by micromanometer and radial pressure by automated tonometry were measured in 20 patients at steady state and during hemodynamic transients (Valsalva maneuver, abdominal compression, nitroglycerin, or vena caval obstruction). For each patient, transfer functions (TFs) between aortic and radial pressures were calculated by parametric model and results averaged to yield individual TFs. A generalized TF was the average of individual functions. TFs varied among patients, with coefficients of variation for peak amplitude and frequency at peak amplitude of 24.9% and 16.9%, respectively. Intrapatient TF variance with altered loading (>20% variation in peak amplitude) was observed in 28.5% of patients. Despite this, the generalized TF estimated central arterial pressures to <= 0.2±3.8 mm Hg error, arterial compliance to 6±7% accuracy, and augmentation index to within -7% points (30±45% accuracy). Individual TFs were only marginally superior to the generalized TF for reconstructing central pressures.\par
  {\em Conclusions} Central aortic pressures can be accurately estimated from radial tonometry with the use of a generalized TF. The reconstructed waveform can provide arterial compliance estimates but may underestimate the augmentation index because the latter requires greater fidelity reproduction of the wave contour.},

  abstract  = {A new three-dimensional (3-D) 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) display method is presented which employs a 3-D rectangular coordinate system to display the 12-lead cardiac electric signals in two 3-D graphs. The 3-D graph consists of a temporal axis representing the time domain of the cardiac signals, a spatial axis representing the lead positions, and an amplitude axis representing the voltages of the cardiac signals. The six horizontal plane leads and the other six frontal plane leads were displayed in two 3-D graphs, respectively. The voltages of the cardiac signals were represented in rainbow-like colors. Cubic interpolation was employed to insert interconnecting points between neighboring leads on each plane and to smooth the surface of the 3-D ECG graphs. The 3-D ECG graphs of a normal subject, a patient with myocardial infarction, and a patient with left bundle branch block were presented in this paper. This new display method could not only be used as a complementary display method to the 12-lead ECG, but also provide physicians with an overall integral view about the spatial distribution of the cardiac signals.},

Genetic defects in membrane ion channels can disrupt the delicate balance of dynamic interactions between the ion channels and the cellular environment, leading to altered cell function.  As ion-channel defects are typically studied in isolated expression systems, away from the cellular environment where they function physiologically, a connection between molecular findings and the physiology and pathophysiology of the cell is rarely established.  Here we describe a single-channel-based Markovian modelling approach that bridges this gap.  We achieve this by determining the cellular arrhythmogenic consequences of a mutation in the cardiac sodium channel that can lead to a clinical arrhythmogenic disorder (the long-QT syndrome) and sudden cardiac death.},

  abstract  = {{\em Background:} A variety of mutations in HERG, the major subunit of the rapidly activating component of the cardiac delayed rectifier \I{Kr}, have been found to underlie the congenital Long-QT syndrome, LQT2. LQT2 may give rise to severe arrhythmogenic phenotypes leading to sudden cardiac death.\par
  {\em Objective:} We attempt to elucidate the mechanisms by which heterogeneous LQT2 genotypes can lead to prolongation of the action potential duration (APD) and consequently the QT interval on the ECG.\par
  {\em Methods:} We develop Markovian models of wild-type (WT) and mutant \I{Kr} channels and incorporate these models into a comprehensive model of the cardiac ventricular cell.\par
  {\em Results:} Using this virtual transgenic cell model, we describe the effects of HERG mutations on the cardiac ventricular action potential (AP) and provide insight into the mechanism by which each defect results in a net loss of repolarizing current and prolongation of APD.\par
  {\em Conclusions:} This study demonstrates which mutations can prolong APD sufficiently to generate early afterdepolarizations (EADs), which may trigger life-threatening arrhythmias. The severity of the phenotype is shown to depend on the specific kinetic changes and how they affect \I{Kr} during the time course of the action potential. Clarifying how defects in HERG can lead to impaired cellular electrophysiology can improve our understanding of the link between channel structure and cellular function.},

Incorporating the effects of the skeletal muscle layer improves the agreement, i.e., correlation coefficients increase to about 0.914 and RMS errors decrease to about 42\%.  At the same time, the lungs and heart have little influence on the agreement between measured and calculated epicardial potentials.

A balloon model was introduced by Cohen (1991) as a way to generalize and solve some of the problems encountered with the original method. A 3-D generalization of the balloon model as a 3-D deformable surface, which evolves in 3-D images, is presented. It is deformed under the action of internal and external forces attracting the surface toward detected edgels by means of an attraction potential. We also show properties of energy-minimizing surfaces concerning their relationship with 3-D edge points. To solve the minimization problem for a surface, two simplified approaches are shown first, defining a 3-D surface as a series of 2-D planar curves. Then, after comparing finite-element method and finite-difference method in the 2-D problem, we solve the 3-D model using the finite-element method yielding greater stability and faster convergence. This model is applied for segmenting magnetic resonance images.},

  abstract  = {We investigate a three-dimensional macroscopic model of wave-front propagation related to the excitation process in the left ventricular wall represented by an anisotropic bidomain. The whole left ventricle is modeled, whereas, in a previous paper, only a flat slab of myocardial tissue was considered. The direction of cardiac fibers, which affects the anisotropic conductivity of the myocardium, rotates from the epi- to the endocardium. If the ventricular wall is conceived as a set of packed surfaces, the fibers may be tangent to them or more generally may cross them obliquely; the latter case is described by an ``imbrication angle.'' The effect of a simplified Purkinje network also is investigated. The cardiac excitation process, more particularly the depolarization phase, is modeled by a nonlinear elliptic equation, called an eikonal equation , in the activation time. The numerical solution of this equation is obtained by means of the finite element method, which includes an upwind treatment of the Hamiltonian part of the equation. By means of numerical simulations in an idealized model of the left ventricle, we try to establish whether the eikonal approach contains the essential basic elements for predicting the features of the activation patterns experimentally observed. We discuss and compare these results with those obtained in our previous papers for a flat part of myocardium. The general rules governing the spread of excitation after local stimulations, previously delineated for the flat geometry, are extended to the present, more realistic monoventricular model.},

Given the transmembrane potential v, associated with the spreading excitation, the extracellular potential u is obtained as the solution of a linear elliptic equation with the source term related to v . The potential distributions were computed for point stimulations at different intramural depths. The results of the simulations enabled us to identify a number of common features which appear in all the potential patterns irrespective of pacing site. In addition, by splitting the sources into an axial and conormal component, we were able to evaluate the contribution of the classical uniform dipole layer to the total potential field and the role of the superimposed axial component.},

To clarify this problem we simulated electrograms (EGs) with a model representing the heart as an anisotropic bidomain with unequal anisotropy ratio, ellipsoidal ventricular geometry, transmural fiber rotation, epi-endocardial obliqueness of fiber direction and a simplified Purkinje network. The EGs were compared with those directly recorded from isolated dog hearts immersed in a conducting medium during ventricular excitation initiated by epicardial stimulation. The simulated EGs share the same multiphasic character of the recorded EGs. The origin of the multiple waves, especially those appearing in the EGs for sites reached by excitation wave fronts spreading across fibers, can be better understood after splitting the current sources, the potential distributions and the EGs into an axial and a conormal component and after taking also into account the effect of the reference or drift component. The split model provides an explanation of humps and spikes that appear in the QRS (the initial part of the ventricular EG) wave forms, in terms of the interaction between the geometry and direction of propagation of the wave front and the architecture of the fibers through which excitation is spreading.},

Using specific formulations of the \ionK, \ionNa, and \ionCa currents based on data recorded from human atrial myocytes, along with representations of pump, exchange, and background currents, we developed a mathematical model of the AP. The model AP resembles APs recorded from human atrial samples and responds to rate changes, L-type \ionCa current blockade, \ionNa/\ionCa exchanger inhibition, and variations in transient outward current amplitude in a fashion similar to experimental recordings. Rate-dependent adaptation of AP duration, an important determinant of susceptibility to atrial fibrillation, was attributable to incomplete L-type \ionCa current recovery from inactivation and incomplete delayed rectifier current deactivation at rapid rates. Experimental observations of variable AP morphology could be accounted for by changes in transient outward current density, as suggested experimentally. We conclude that this mathematical model of the human atrial AP reproduces a variety of observed AP behaviors and provides insights into the mechanisms of clinically important AP properties.},

However, catheter ablation of complex arrhythmias, such as intra-atrial reentry, ventricular tachycardias, and atrial fibrillation, continues to pose a major challenge. This stems from limitations of fluoroscopy and conventional catheter-based mapping techniques that limit the accurate anatomic localization of complex arrhythmogenic substrates. In this article, ECG features of complex arrhythmias are reviewed, which may facilitate the planning of an ablation procedure. The physical principles of the newly available catheter-based endocardial mapping techniques and their clinical applicability for treatment of complex arrhythmias are discussed. The role of intracardiac echocardiography to facilitate mapping and ablation is reviewed.},

  abstract  = {To achieve transcardiac threshold current during transthoracic defibrillation, a considerably larger current must be delivered to the thorax to compensate for the shunting effect of the lungs, the thoracic cage, and other elements of the torso. This shunting effect is thus an important determinant of transthoracic defibrillation threshold and can be quantified by the transcardiac current fraction (FC, the ratio of transcardiac to transthoracic threshold currents). Previous estimates of FC have ranged from as low as 3% to as high as 45%. The purpose of of this study was to quantify both FC and the major intrathoracic current pathways. Transthoracic and intrathoracic voltages and currents were simultaneously measured during high-voltage transthoracic shocks in 20 dogs. With correction factors determined from another set of 12 dogs, these raw data were corrected to compensate for field distortion caused by the presence of the intrathoracic electrodes, and the adjusted data were fit to a resistive network model. The results showed that 82% of the transthoracic current was shunted by the thoracic cage, while 14% was shunted by the lungs. The remaining 4% (FC) is the portion that passed through the heart. There was good agreement between the two independent methods used to calculate FC. Analysis based on the model indicated that FC was 3.7%, whereas FC determined by direct measurement with calibrated electrodes was 4.2%. Therefore, the results of this study, in contrast to earlier estimates of FC, show that defibrillation in dogs is achieved by only 4% of the total transthoracic current.},

  abstract  = {{\em Background} Nonuniform recovery of ventricular excitability has been demonstrated to facilitate the reentry circuits leading to the development of ventricular tachyarrhythmias. This can also occur in arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD). In fact, in patients with ARVD, abnormalities of ventricular repolarization are often observed on 12-lead ECGs, but their predictive value for the occurrence of malignant arrhythmias is yet to be established. Because body-surface potential mapping has been proved to be useful for the detection of heterogeneities in ventricular recovery even though they are not revealed by conventional 12-lead ECGs, we attempted to analyze repolarization potentials on the entire chest surface to find abnormalities that can be predictive of ventricular arrhythmias. \par
  {\em Methods and Results} Body-surface potential maps were recorded from 62 anterior and posterior thoracic leads in 22 patients affected by ARVD, 9 with episodes of sustained ventricular tachycardias (VT) and 13 without. Thirty-five healthy subjects were also studied as control subjects. The 62 chest ECGs were simultaneously recorded, digitally converted at a rate of 2000 Hz, and stored on a hard disk of a body-surface mapping computer system. In each subject, the QRST integral map was obtained by calculating at each lead point the algebraic sum of all instantaneous potentials, from the QRS onset to the T-wave end, multiplied by the sampling interval. In most ARVD patients, we observed a larger-than-normal area of negative values on the right anterior thorax. This abnormal pattern could be explained by a delayed repolarization of the right ventricle. Nevertheless, it was not related to the occurrence of VT in our patient population. To detect minor heterogeneities of ventricular repolarization, the principal component analysis was applied to the 62 ST-T waves recorded in each subject. We assumed that a low value of the first or of the first three components (components 1, 2, and 3) indicates a greater-than-normal variety of the ST-T waves, a likely expression of a more complex recovery process. The mean values of the first three components were not significantly different in ARVD patients and control subjects. Nevertheless, considering the two subsets of patients with and without VT, the values of component 1, components 1+2, and component 1+2+3 were significantly lower in the group of ARVD patients with VT. Values of component 1 < 69% (equal to 1 SD below the mean value for control subjects) were found in 6 of 9 VT patients and in 1 patient without VT (sensitivity, 67%; specificity, 92%). A low value of component 1 was the only variable significantly associated with the occurrence of VT. \par
  {\em Conclusions} Principal component analysis provides a better quantitative assessment of the complexity of repolarization than other ECG measurements. When applied to ARVD patients, principal component analysis of the ST-T waves recorded from the entire chest surface revealed abnormalities not detected by conventional ECG that can be considered indexes of arrhythmia vulnerability.},

This study evaluated the ef  cacy of a three-dimensional (3D) real-time position management system in guiding RFCA procedures in patients.\par
  {\em Methods and Results:} Patients (n=30, age 59+/-20 years) referred for ablation of either atrial flutter (n=10), ventricular tachycardia (n=15), or accessory pathways (n=5) were studied. The real-time position management system uses ultrasound ranging techniques to track the position of an ablation catheter relative to two multitransducer reference catheters, positioned in the right atrium or coronary sinus and the right ventricle. Each catheter contains three or four ultrasound transducers. The distance between the transducer(s) is determined by calculating the time necessary for an ultrasound pulse to reach other transducers, assuming the speed of sound in blood is 1,550 m/sec. The proximal His bundle was marked at the beginning and the end of the procedure as an electrical landmark to verify reproducibility. After identification of target sites, the position of each lesion created with the ablation catheter was marked. Successful ablation was achieved in 94% of the patients. The distance between the location of the proximal His bundle as marked at the beginning and at the end of the procedure was 2.0+/-1.2 mm (range 1.5 to 3.5).\par
  {\em Conclusion:} The new 3D real-time position management system facilitated RFCA procedures as it allowed accurate and reproducible 3D tracking of the mapping and ablation catheter. },

  {\em Methods and Results:} To investigate the role of endocardial and epicardial structures and their interaction in atrial conduction and arrhythmias, we used five epicardial plaques and two intra-atrial balloon arrays to record a total of 368 unipolar electrograms from the entire epicardial and endocardial surface of both atria. During regular 1:1 pacing from the right atrial appendage, right atrial endocardial activation spread considerably faster than epicardial (total activation time 45 ± 12 msec vs 60 ± 19 msec, respectively [mean ± SD]; P < 0.05), pointing to preferential conduction over structures like the crista terminalis and pectinate muscles. No such differences were noted in the left atrium. Transseptal spread occurred via discrete anterior and posterior pathways, causing separate breakthroughs in anterior and posterior atrial regions, respectively. Dissociation between septal pathways played a role in reentry during vagal atrial fibrillation. In 2 of 4 dogs with atrial fibrillation associated with congestive heart failure, single macroreentrant circuits involving endocardial and epicardial components were revealed during the arrhythmia.\par
  {\em Conclusion:} We conclude that activation mapping using simultaneous recording from both epicardial and endocardial surfaces provides potentially important insights into the mechanisms of atrial conduction and arrhythmogenesis.},

An optimum inverse transfer coefficient matrix, relating intracavitary potentials to endocardial potentials, is computed and subsequently used to calculate the best linear estimate of the true endocardial potentials.

The LV cavity geometry is measured from postmortem magnetic resonance microscopy images of fixed hearts. The results indicate that for electrical pacing from the apex, intracavity stimulus potentials can be calculated with a high degree of accuracy. For nonapical pacing locations, the accuracy decreases since the calculations are more sensitive to errors in measuring probe position and LV cavity geometry near the septum.

  abstract  = {Equations have been developed to describe cardiac action potentials and pacemaker activity. The model takes account of extensive developments in experimental work since the formulation of the MNT (RE McAllister, D Noble and RW Tsien, J Physiol, Lond. 251, 1-59 (1975)) and BR (GW Beeler and H Reuter, J Physiol, Lond. 268, 177-210 (1977)) equations.\par
  The current mechanism \i{K2} has been replaced by the hyperpolarizing-activated current, \i{f}. Depletion and accumulation of potassium ions in the extracellular space are represented either by partial differential equations for diffusion in cylindrical or spherical preparations or, when such accuracy is not essential, by a three-compartment model in which the extracellular concentration in the intercellular space is uniform. The description of the delayed K current, \i{K}, remains based on the work of D Noble and RW Tsien (J Physiol, Lond. 200, 205-231 (1969a)). The instantaneous inward-rectifier, \i{K1}, is based on S Hagiwara and K Takahashi's equation (J Membrane Biol 18, 61-80 (1974)) and on the patch clamp studies of B Sakmann and G Trube (J Physiol, Lond. 347, 641-658 (1984)) and of Y Momose, G Szabo and WR Giles (Biophys J 41, 311a (1983)). The equations successfully account for all the properties formerly attributed to \i{K2}, as well as giving more complete descriptions of \i{K1} and \i{K}.\par
  The sodium current equations are based on experimental data of TJ Colatsky (J Physiol, Lond. 305, 215-234 (1980)) and AM Brown, KS Lee and T Powell (J Physiol, Lond. 318, 479-500 (1981)). The equations correctly reproduce the range and magnitude of the sodium `window' current.\par
  The second inward current is based in part on the data of H Reuter and H Scholz (J Physiol, Lond. 264, 17-47 (1977)) and KS Lee and RW Tsien (Nature, Lond. 297, 498-501 (1982)) so far as the ion selectivity is concerned. However, the activation and inactivation gating kinetics have been greatly speeded up to reproduce the very much faster currents recorded in recent work. A major consequence of this change is that Ca current inactivation mostly occurs very early in the action potential plateau.\par
  The sodium-potassium exchange pump equations are based on data reported by DC Gadsby (Proc natn Acad Sci USA 77, 4035-4039 (1980)) and by DA Eisner and WJ Lederer (J Physiol, Lond. 303, 441-474 (1980)). The sodium-calcium exchange current is based on LJ Mullins' equations (J gen Physiol 70, 681-695 (1977)). Intracellular calcium sequestration is represented by simple equations for uptake into a reticulum store which then reprimes a release store. The repriming equations use the data of WR Gibbons & HA Fozzard (J gen Physiol 65, 367-384 (1975b)). Following Fabiato & Fabiato's work (J Physiol, Lond. 249, 469-495 (1975)), Ca release is assumed to be triggered by intracellular free calcium. The equations reproduce the essential features of intracellular free calcium transients as measured with aequorin. ...},
  comment   = {... The explanatory range of the model entirely includes and greatly extends that of the MNT equations. Despite the major changes made, the overall time-course of the conductance changes to potassium ions strongly resembles that of the MNT model. There are however important differences in the time courses of Na and Ca conductance changes. The Na conductance now includes a component due to the hyperpolarizing-activated current, \i{f}, which slowly increases during the pacemaker depolarization. The Ca conductance changes are very much faster than in the MNT model so that in action potentials longer than about 50 ms the primary contribution of the fast gated calcium channel to the plateau is due to a steady-state `window' current or non-inactivated component. Slower calcium or Ca-activated currents, such as the Na-Ca exchange current, or Ca-gated currents, or a much slower Ca channel must then play the dynamic role previously attributed to the kinetics of a single type of calcium channel. This feature of the model in turn means that the repolarization process should be related to the inotropic state, as indicated by experimental work.\par
  The model successfully reproduces intracellular sodium concentration changes produced by variations in [Na]$_o$, or Na-K pump block. The sodium dependence of the overshoot potential is well reproduced despite the fact that steady state intracellular Na is proportional to extracellular Na, as in the experimental results of D Ellis (J Physiol, Lond. 274, 211-240 (1977)).\par
  The model reproduces the responses to current pulses applied during the plateau and pacemaker phases. In particular, a substantial net decrease in conductance is predicted during the pacemaker depolarization despite the fact that the controlling process is an increase in conductance for the hyperpolarizing-activated current. The immediate effects of changing extracellular [K] are reproduced, including: (i) the shortening of action potential duration and suppression of pacemaker activity at high [K]; (ii) the increased automaticity at moderately low [K]; and (iii) the depolarization to the plateau range with premature depolarizations and low voltage oscillations at very low [K].\par
  The ionic currents attributed to changes in Na-K pump activity are well reproduced. It is shown that the apparent K$_m$ for K activation of the pump depends strongly on the size of the restricted extracellular space. With a 30% space (as in canine Purkinje fibres) the apparent K$_m$ is close to the assumed real value of 1 mM. When the extracellular space is reduced to below 5%, the apparent K$_m$ increases by up to an order of magnitude. A substantial part of the pump is then not available for inhibition by low [K]$_b$. These results can explain the apparent discrepancies in the literature concerning the K$_m$ for pump activation.},

Other objectives were to address the question of reciprocal ST-segment changes observed in the 12-lead electrocardiogram during ischemia and to verify the hypothesis that the shortening of the QRS duration observed in left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery occlusion may be explained by conduction delay in the septal His-Purkinje system. Simulation was achieved by first introducing into the heart model three transmural zones of mild, moderate, and severe ischemia for assumed occlusions in the LAD, left circumflex, and right coronary arteries. The heart model was then excited, in turn, with these three zones present for assumed occlusions in the LAD, left circumflex, and right coronary arteries. Myocardial conduction velocities in the regions of moderate and severe ischemia were assumed to be reduced to 75 and 50% of normal, respectively. Model action potentials in the mild, moderate, and severely ischemic zones were also altered to reflect known ischemic changes in these action potentials. Body surface potential maps and electrocardiograms were computed by placing the heart inside a numerical torso model. Simulated map patterns during both ST-segment and QRS were qualitatively similar to clinical maps. Reciprocal ST-segment depression was observed for all three occlusions in remote leads that did not overlie the ischemic zones. QRS shortening due to septal His-Purkinje conduction delay was verified. The simulation results attest to the model's ability to reproduce body surface potential distributions recorded following percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty protocols. The simulations also showed that reciprocal ST-segment changes occur as a natural consequence of the primary ischemic region and that there is no need to invoke a second region of ischemia. Finally, the model demonstrated that QRS shortening can occur in LAD occlusion despite a slowing of conduction down the septal His-Purkinje system.},

  abstract  = {BACKGROUND. A pace mapping technique using body surface potential maps (BSPMs) was developed to guide the positioning of an ablation catheter at the ventricular insertion point of accessory pathways (AP) in patients with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW). \par
  METHODS AND RESULTS. The study was performed on 30 WPW patients. BSPMs were recorded with 63 leads distributed over the entire torso surface. The catheter used for radiofrequency ablation was first placed in the vicinity of the ventricular preexcitation site predicted by BSPMs recorded during the delta wave. BSPMs were then recorded during pacing with this catheter, the comparison between the preexcited and paced BSPMs indicated whether the pacing site was too anterior or posterior with respect to the preexcitation site, and the catheter was moved accordingly. This process was repeated until the preexcited and paced BSPMs were highly correlated (r >= 0.8), and ablation then was attempted. It was possible to successfully ablate the AP in 28 patients after an investigation that lasted 54 +/- 44 minutes between the recording of the first paced BSPM and that of the BSPM paced at the successful ablation site. Patients with left free wall pathways needed less investigation time compared with patients with pathways of other locations (46 +/- 9 versus 100 +/- 25 minutes, p = 0.031). The sensitivity of BSPM pace mapping was assessed using pacing with a multipolar catheter, and significant changes were observed on the BSPMs for beats with pacing sites that were only 5 mm apart. \par
  CONCLUSIONS. BSPM pace mapping allowed us to achieve a 93% success rate with short investigation durations, provides significant information that cannot be obtained with the standard 12-lead ECG, is a self-correcting procedure that reduces the importance of BSPM alterations due to individual differences in the shape of the torso or heart, and is applicable only to patients with AP showing antegrade conduction.},

  abstract  = {A heart-torso model including fiber orientation is used to calculate electric field strength in an active-can transvenous defibrillation system and estimate errors due to inadequate description of the anisotropy of the myocardium. Using a minimum potential gradient (5 V/cm) in a critical mass (95%) of the tissue, the estimated defibrillation voltage threshold for a right ventricular transvenous lead placement differs by only 4.5% when using isotropic myocardial conductivity compared to a model with realistic fiber architecture. In addition, pointwise comparisons of the two solutions reveal differences of 10.8% rms in potential gradient strength and 31.6% rms in current density magnitude in the myocardium, resulting in a change in the location of the low gradient regions. These results suggest that if a minimum potential gradient throughout the heart is necessary to avoid reinitiation of fibrillatory wave fronts, then isotropic models are adequate for modeling the electric field in the heart. Alternatively, the model demonstrates the use of physiologically based descriptions of anisotropy and fiber orientation, which will soon allow simulations of shock induced membrane polarization during defibrillation.},

This paper directly tests these assumptions for high-density electrode arrays. Using a finite element model with modified Fitzhugh-Nagumo kinetics, the authors represent electrodes as isopotential surfaces of varying widths and spacing ratio (SR) (center-to-center spacing divided by electrode width). They examine the signal strength and ability of a single electrode to detect activation due to a passing wavefront. They find that high-density arrays do not cause significant wavefront curvature or alter activation timing in the underlying tissue. Relationships between signal strength, cross talk, and array design are explained by the interaction of the propagating wavefront and induced sources on the isopotential electrodes. Sensitivity analysis shows that these results may be generalized to a wide range of physiologically relevant designs and applications. It is concluded that electrode array designs in which electrode spacing greatly exceeds electrode diameter are overly conservative and that arrays with a SR of less than 2.0 may perform successfully in electrophysiological studies.},

The data chosen from that study for quantitative analysis was obtained at 37$\degrees$C and in standard tissue-culture medium; it was not smoothed, and the capacitive transient was sufficiently brief to make its removal unnecessary. The sodium current, \I{Na}, is considered to be given by the following equation: $\I{Na} = g_{Na} m^3h(V - V_{Na})$, where $g_{Na}$ is a constant (23 mS), $V_{Na}$ is the sodium equilibrium potential (29 mV), and m and h are independent, first order, dimensionless variables, which can vary between 0 and 1, as defined by the following differential equations, dm/dt = \alpha_m(1 - m) - \beta_m m and dh/dt = \alpha_h(1 - h) - \beta_h h, where the rate coefficients, \alpha_m = [0.32 x (V + 47.13)]/[1 - exp(V + 47.13)] and beta_m = 0.08 x exp (-V/11). For potentials more positive than -40 mV, alpha_h = 0 and beta_h = 1/0.13 (exp [(V + 10.66)/ - 11.1] + 1), and for potentials more negative than -40 mV, alpha_h = 0.135 x exp [(-80 - V)/6.8] and beta_h = 3.56 x exp (0.079V) + 3.1 x 10(5) exp (0.35V). These functions of potential are similar to those of the squid at 15$\degrees$C, except that their magnitudes are larger (faster). Using these model equations the membrane current in a membrane patch with and without a series resistance was simulated. For the value of series resistance estimated for the preparation from which the analyzed data were obtained, the effects of series resistance on the shape and magnitude of the inward transient current were found to be minimal. It was concluded that their should be no large errors in the data, even in the absence of complete series resistance compensation.},

The goal of this study was to identify possible mechanisms of vulnerability and defibrillation by externally applied shocks in vitro. We used bidomain simulations of realistic rabbit heart fibrous geometry to predict the passive polarization throughout the heart induced by external shocks. We also used optical mapping to assess anterior epicardium electrical activity during shocks in Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts (n = 7). Monophasic shocks of either polarity (10-260 V, 8 ms, 150 µF) were applied during the T wave from a pair of mesh electrodes. Postshock epicardial virtual electrode polarization was observed after all 162 applied shocks, with positive polarization facing the cathode and negative polarization facing the anode, as predicted by the bidomain simulations. During arrhythmogenesis, a new wave front was induced at the boundary between the two regions near the apex but not at the base. It spread across the negatively polarized area toward the base of the heart and reentered on the other side while simultaneously spreading into the depth of the wall. Thus a scroll wave with a ribbon-shaped filament was formed during external shock-induced arrhythmia. Fluorescent imaging and passive bidomain simulations demonstrated that virtual electrode polarization-induced scroll waves underlie mechanisms of shock-induced vulnerability and failure of external defibrillation.},

  abstract  = {{\em Background} Two important signal processing applications in electrophysiology are activation mapping and characterization of the tissue substrate from which electrograms are recorded. We hypothesize that a novel signal-processing method that uses deconvolution is more accurate than amplitude, derivative, and manual activation time estimates. We further hypothesize that deconvolution quantifies changes in morphology that detect electrograms recorded from regions of myocardial infarction.\par
  {\em Methods and Results} To determine the accuracy of activation time estimation, 600 unipolar electrograms were calculated with a detailed computer model using various degrees of coupling heterogeneity to model infarction. Local activation time was defined as the time of peak inward sodium current in the modeled myocyte closest to the electrode. Deconvolution, minimum derivative, and maximum amplitude were calculated. Two experienced electrophysiologists blinded to the computer-determined activation times marked their estimates of activation time. F tests compared the variance of activation time estimation for each method. To evaluate the performance of deconvolution to detect infarction, 380 unipolar electrograms were recorded from 10 dogs with infarcts resulting from ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery. The amplitude, duration, number of inflections, peak frequency, bandwidth, minimum derivative, and deconvolution were calculated. Metrics were compared by Mann-Whitney rank-sum tests, and receiver operating curves were plotted.\par
  {\em Conclusions} Deconvolution estimated local activation time more accurately than the other metrics (P<.0001). Furthermore, the algorithm quantified changes in morphology (P<.0001) with superior performance, detecting electrograms recorded from regions of myocardial infarction. Thus, deconvolution, which incorporates a priori knowledge of electrogram morphology, shows promise to improve present clinical metrics.},

The recent discovery of a genetic mutation in the cardiac sodium channel in some patients with the congenital LQTS, resulting in abnormal gating behavior similar to sodium channels exposed to AP-A, provides a strong endorsement of this animal model as a valid surrogate to the clinical syndrome of LQTS. In the present study, we conducted high-resolution tridimensional isochronal mapping of both activation and repolarization patterns in puppies exposed to AP-A that developed LQTS and polymorphic ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VTs). To map repolarization, we measured activation-recovery intervals (ARIs) using multiple unipolar extracellular electrograms. We demonstrated, for the first time in vivo, the existence of spatial dispersion of repolarization in the ventricular wall and differences in regional recovery in response to cycle-length changes that were markedly exaggerated after AP-A administration. Analysis of tridimensional activation patterns showed that the initial beat of polymorphic VT consistently arose as focal activity from a subendocardial site, whereas subsequent beats were due to successive subendocardial focal activity, reentrant excitation, or a combination of both mechanisms. Reentrant excitation was due to infringement of a focal activity on the spatial dispersion of repolarization, resulting in functional conduction block and circulating wave fronts. The polymorphic QRS configuration of VT in the LQTS was due to either changing the site of origin of focal activity, resulting in varying activation patterns, or varying orientations of circulating wave fronts.},

The study utilizes a three-dimensional finite element model and the continuous bidomain representation of cardiac tissue to model steady-state polarization resulting from a defibrillation-strength uniform applied field. Fiber architecture is incorporated in the model via the shape of the heart, an ellipsoid of variable ellipticity index, and via an analytical function, linear or nonlinear, describing the transmural fiber rotation. Analytical estimates and numerical results are provided for the location and shape of the ``bulk'' polarization (polarization away from the tissue boundaries) as a function of the fiber field, or more specifically, of the conductivity changes in axial and radial direction with respect to the applied electrical field lines. Polarization in the tissue ``bulk'' is shown to exist only under the condition of unequal anisotropy ratios in the extra-- and intracellular spaces. Variations in heart geometry and, thus, fiber curvature, are found to lead to change in location of the zones of significant membrane polarization. The transmural fiber rotation function modulates the transmembrane potential profile in the radial direction. A higher gradient of the transmural transmembrane potential is observed in the presence of fiber rotation as compared to the no rotation case. The analysis presented here is a step forward in understanding the interaction between tissue structure and applied electric field in establishing the pattern of membrane polarization during the initial phase of the defibrillation shock.},

Using basis functions derived from a training set of 221 maps, the estimated average rms error of representation was 60 \micro V during the QRS and 25 \micro V during the ST-T. For 34 test maps which were not part of the training set, measured average errors were 64 \micro V during the QRS and 23 \micro V during the ST-T.

The resulting increased \ionCa influx triggers a greater [\ionCa]$_i$ transient. 5) Reverse-mode \I{NaCa} alone can trigger \ionCa release in a voltage and [\ionNa]$_i$-dependent manner. 6) During \I{NaK} block, \ionNa and \ionCa accumulate and APD shortens due to enhanced reverse-mode \I{NaCa}; contribution of \I{K(Na)} to APD shortening is negligible. By slowing AP depolarization (hence velocity) and shortening APD, \ionNa-overload acts to enhance inducibility of reentrant arrhythmias. Shortened APD with elevated [\ionCa]$_i$ (secondary to \ionNa-overload) also predisposes the myocardium to arrhythmogenic delayed afterdepolarizations.},

  abstract  = {The electric resistivity of various human tissues has been reported in many studies, but on comparison large differences appear between these studies. The aim of this study was to investigate systematically the resistivities of human tissues as published in review studies (100 Hz-10 MHz).\par
  A data set of 103 resistivities for 21 different human tissues was compiled from six review studies. For each kind of tissue the mean and its 95% confidence interval were calculated. Moreover, an analysis of covariance showed that the calculated means were not statistically different for most tissues, namely skeletal (171 \Omega cm) and cardiac (175 \Omega cm) muscle, kidney (211 \Omega cm), liver (342 \Omega cm), lung (157 \Omega cm) and spleen (405 \Omega cm), with bone (>17 583 \Omega cm), fat (3850 \Omega cm) and, most likely, the stratum corneum of the skin having higher resistivities.\par
  The insignificance of differences between various tissue means could imply an equality of their resistivities, or, alternatively, could be the result of the large confidence intervals which obscured real existing differences. In either case, however, the large 95% confidence intervals reflected large uncertainties in our knowledge of resistivities of human tissues. Applications based on these resistivities in bioimpedance methods, EEG and EKG, should be developed and evaluated with these uncertainties in mind.},

However, advances made recently in the theory of generic excitable media suggest that an additional factor--the geometry of excitation wavefronts--may play an important role. In particular, impulse propagation strongly depends on the wavefront curvature on a small spatial scale. In the heart, excitation wavefronts have pronounced curvatures in several situations including waves initiated by small electrodes, waves emerging from narrow tissue structures, and waves propagating around the sharp edges of anatomical obstacles or around a zone of functional conduction block during spiral wave rotation. In this short review we consider the theoretical background relating impulse propagation to wavefront curvature and we estimate the role of wavefront curvature in electrical stimulation, formation of conduction block, and the dynamic behavior of spiral waves.},

  abstract  = {This study investigated the activation of cardiac tissue by ``secondary sources,'' which are localized changes of the transmembrane potential ($V_m$) during the application of strong extracellular electrical shocks far from the shock electrodes, in cultures of neonatal rat myocytes. Cell monolayers with small intercellular clefts (length, 45 to 270 µm; width, 20 to 70 µm [mean±SD, 54±13 µm]; n=46) were produced using a technique of directed cell growth. Changes in $V_m$ relative to the action potential amplitude ($\Delta V_m$/APA) were measured using a fluorescent voltage-sensitive dye and a 10x10 photodiode array. Shocks with voltage gradients of 4 to 18 V/cm were applied across the clefts during either the action potential (AP) plateau or diastole. During the AP plateau, shocks induced secondary sources in the form of localized hyperpolarizations and depolarizations in the regions immediately adjacent to opposite sides of the clefts. The strength of the secondary sources, defined as the difference of $\Delta V_m$/APA across a cleft, increased with increasing cleft length or increasing electrical field gradient. For shocks with a gradient of 8.5 V/cm, the estimated critical cleft length necessary to reach a $V_m$ level corresponding to the diastolic threshold of excitation was 171±7 µm. Accordingly, shocks with average strength of 8.2 V/cm applied during diastole produced secondary sources that directly excited cells adjacent to the clefts when the cleft length was 196±53 µm (n=14) and that failed when the cleft length was 84±23 µm (n=9, P<001). The area of earliest excitation in such cases coincided with the area of maximal depolarization induced during the plateau phase. These data suggest that small inexcitable obstacles may contribute to the $V_m$ changes during the application of strong extracellular electrical shocks in vivo.},

To determine the shock-induced $\Delta V_m$ in such structures, cell strands of variable width [strand width (SW) = 0.15-2 mm] were grown in culture. Uniform-field shocks with variable strength [shock strength (SS) = 2-50 V/cm] were applied across strands during the action potential (AP) plateau, and $\Delta V_m$ were measured optically. Three different types of $\Delta V_m$ were observed. Small $\Delta V_m$ [<40%AP amplitude (APA)] were linearly dependent on SS and SW and were symmetrically distributed about a strand centerline with maximal positive and negative $\Delta V_m$ on opposite strand sides being equal. Intermediate $\Delta V_m$ (<200%APA) were strongly asymmetric with negative $\Delta V_m$ > positive $\Delta V_m$ because of a negative time-dependent shift of $V_m$ at the depolarized side of the strands. For large $\Delta V_m$ (>200%APA), a second time-dependent shift of Vm to more positive levels was observed in the hyperpolarized portions of strands, causing reduction of the $\Delta V_m$ asymmetry. We conclude that during application of shocks to cell strands during the AP plateau, passive changes of $V_m$ were followed by two voltage- and time-dependent shifts of $V_m$, possibly reflecting changes of ionic currents or membrane electroporation.},

In this paper we describe the development of a number of three-dimensional ultrasound imaging systems that make use of B mode, color Doppler, and power Doppler. In these systems, the conventional ultrasound transducer is scanned mechanically or by a freehand technique. The ultrasound images are digitized and then reconstructed into a three-dimensional volume, which can be viewed and manipulated interactively by the diagnostician with a variety of image-rendering techniques. These developments as well as future trends are discussed with regard to their applications and limitations.},

  abstract  = {Ultrasound is an inexpensive and widely used imaging modality for the diagnosis and staging of a number of diseases. In the past two decades, it has benefited from major advances in technology and has become an indispensable imaging modality, due to its flexibility and non-invasive character. In the last decade, research investigators and commercial companies have further advanced ultrasound imaging with the development of 3D ultrasound. This new imaging approach is rapidly achieving widespread use with numerous applications.\par
  The major reason for the increase in the use of 3D ultrasound is related to the limitations of 2D viewing of 3D anatomy, using conventional ultrasound. This occurs because: (a) Conventional ultrasound images are 2D, yet the anatomy is 3D, hence the diagnostician must integrate multiple images in his mind. This practice is inefficient, and may lead to variability and incorrect diagnoses. (b) The 2D ultrasound image represents a thin plane at some arbitrary angle in the body. It is difficult to localize the image plane and reproduce it at a later time for follow-up studies.\par
  In this review article we describe how 3D ultrasound imaging overcomes these limitations. Specifically, we describe the developments of a number of 3D ultrasound imaging systems using mechanical, free-hand and 2D array scanning techniques. Reconstruction and viewing methods of the 3D images are described with specific examples. Since 3D ultrasound is used to quantify the volume of organs and pathology, the sources of errors in the reconstruction techniques as well as formulae relating design specification to geometric errors are provided. Finally, methods to measure organ volume from the 3D ultrasound images and sources of errors are described.},

The factors considered in this paper are: numerical approximations intrinsic to the BEM, such as constant-potential versus linear-potential basis functions and sharp-edged versus smooth-surfaced volumes; aspects of the volume conductor including the volume shape, density of surface elements, and element shape; source position and orientation; and effects of  refinements  in the numerical methods.  The effects of these factors are considered in both smooth-shaped (spheres and spheroids) and sharp-edged (cubes) volume conductors.  This represents the first attempt to assess the effects of many of these factors pertaining to the numerical methods commonly used in fields such as electrocardiography (ECG) and electroencephalography (EEG).

This paper focuses on the use of TLS for solving problems with very ill-conditioned coefficient matrices whose singular values decay gradually (so-called discrete ill-posed problems), where some regularization is necessary to stabilize the computed solution. We filter the solution by truncating the small singular values of the TLS matrix. We express our results in terms of the singular value decomposition (SVD) of the coefficient matrix rather than the augmented matrix. This leads to insight into the filtering properties of the truncated TLS method as compared to regularized least squares solutions. In addition, we propose and test an iterative algorithm based on Lanczos bidiagonalization for computing truncated TLS solutions.},

  abstract  = {This article is a review of the history of the string galvanometer and of the electrocardiogram (ECG) on the occasion of the centennial of the instrument. Einthoven most likely developed the string galvanometer prior to 1901, the date of the first publication. The galvanometer made electrocardiography practical creating a new branch of medicine and even a new industry. In 1791 Galvani, in 1842 Mateucci and in 1855 Kolliker and Muller recorded, using the nerve muscle preparation, contraction of injured muscle, contraction of muscle when laid across a beating heart, and occasionally two contractions. In 1872 Lippmann introduced the capillary manometer. Using the capillary manometer Waller recorded for the first time from body surface voltage changes generated by the heart. Einthoven and Lewis dominated the early years of electrocardiography. The former made his contributions by 1913 while Lewis continued the studies of arrhythmias until 1920. The period following 1920 was influenced largely by Wilson. None did as much to advance ECG knowledge as did Wilson. The interest shifted to the theory of the ECG, abnormalities of wave form and of ECG leads. A major contribution of the ECG is in evaluation of ischemic heart disease and cardiac arrhythmias. Issues facing electrocardiography in the year 2000 include a shortage of experienced electrocardiographers, the advent of new noninvasive procedures and, paradoxically, wide acceptance of the ECG by the medical profession. The role of the computer in analysis of the clinical ECG is limited. The technique, while reasonably reliable for analysis of the normal tracing and some ECG waveforms, has serious limitations when applied to arrhythmias. The early hopes for ``stand-alone'' programs are yet to be realized.},

  abstract  = {A hybrid boundary element method (BEM)/finite element method (FEM) approach is proposed in order to properly consider the anisotropic properties of the cardiac muscle in the magneto- and electrocardiographic forward problem. Within the anisotropic myocardium a bidomain model based FEM formulation is applied. In the surrounding isotropic volume conductor the BEM is adopted. Coupling is enabled by requesting continuity of the electric potential and the normal of the current density across the boundary of the heart. Here, the BEM part is coupled as an equivalent finite element to the finite element stiffness matrix, thus preserving in part its sparse property. First, continuous convergence of the coupling scheme is shown for a spherical model comparing the computed results to an analytic reference solution. Then, the method is extended to the depolarization phase in a fibrous model of a dog ventricle. A precomputed activation sequence obtained using a fine mesh of the heart was downsampled and used to calculate body surface potentials and extracorporal magnetic fields considering the anisotropic bidomain conductivities. Results are compared to those obtained by neglecting in part or totally (oblique or uniform dipole layer model) anisotropic properties. The relatively large errors computed indicate that the cardiac muscle is one of the major torso inhomogeneities.},

The individual torso geometry was obtained by magnetic resonance imaging. Based on this data the AT map was estimated for the entire ventricular surface off-line for validation purposes.\par
  The AT maps were computed for a pacing protocol in the region of the right ventricular apex and for sinus rhythm beats prior and after successful pathway ablation. For paced beats the first onset activation was always found to be located in the apical region of the right ventricular endocardium. For beats in sinus rhythm prior to pathway ablation the location of the first onset of activation matched with the anatomic position of the ablation catheter during successful ablation. After the treatment this spot of early basal activation disappeared in the computed AT maps. Thus, we conclude that noninvasive AT imaging from ECG mapping data presents a novel clinical tool for assessment of cardiac electrical activation in reference to the associated anatomy.},

In the inverse problem (nonlinear dipole fit), errors introduced by an erroneous zero-potential-definition can lead to displacements of more than 5 mm in the computed dipole location. For the FEM, a method similar to matrix deflation is proposed in order to properly consider the Wilson central terminal. The matrix obtained from this manipulation is symmetric, sparse and positive definite enabling the application of standard FEM-solvers.},

Additionally, the algorithm results in quasi-analytic expressions of the derivatives of the surface potential with respect to the location of the sources, allowing the use of optimization techniques with better convergence properties.

We present a new measure of Rd based on the root-mean-square (RMS) curve of an ECG lead set and compare its performance with that of the commonly used QT dispersion (QTd) measure with the use of recovery times measured from directly recorded canine electrograms.\par
  {\em Methods and Results} -- Using isolated, perfused canine hearts suspended in a torso-shaped electrolytic tank, we simultaneously recorded electrograms from 64 epicardial sites and ECGs from 192 ``body surface'' sites. RMS curves were derived from 4 lead sets: epicardial, body surface, precordial, and a 6-lead optimal set. Repolarization was altered by changing cycle length, temperature, and activation sequence. Rd, calculated directly from recovery times of the 64 epicardial potentials, was then compared with the width of the T wave of the RMS curve and with QTd for each of these 4 lead sets. The correlation between T-wave width and Rd for each lead set, respectively, was epicardium, 0.91; body surface, 0.84; precordial, 0.72; and optimal leads, 0.81. The correlation between QTd and Rd for each lead set was epicardium, 0.46; body surface, 0.47; precordial, 0.17; and optimal leads, 0.11.\par
  {\em Conclusions} -- RMS curve analysis provides an accurate method of estimating Rd from the body surface. In contrast, QTd analysis provides a poor estimate of Rd.},

In fibrillation, fragmented electrical waves meander erratically through the heart muscle, creating disordered and ineffective contraction. Theoretical and computer studies, as well as recent experimental evidence, have suggested that fibrillation is created and sustained by the property of restitution of the cardiac action potential duration (that is, its dependence on the previous diastolic interval). The restitution hypothesis states that steeply sloped restitution curves create unstable wave propagation that results in wave break, the event that is necessary for fibrillation. Here we present experimental evidence supporting this idea. In particular, we identify the action of the drug bretylium as a prototype for the future development of effective restitution-based antifibrillatory agents. We show that bretylium acts in accord with the restitution hypothesis: by flattening restitution curves, it prevents wave break and thus prevents fibrillation. It even converts existing fibrillation, either to a periodic state (ventricular tachycardia, which is much more easily controlled) or to quiescent healthy tissue.},

To gain more insight into these factors we have reconstructed from nuclear magnetic images the three-dimensional shape of the diaphragm of four normal subjects under supine relaxed conditions at four different VLs: residual volume, functional residual capacity, functional residual capacity plus one-half of the inspiratory capacity, and total lung capacity. Under our experimental conditions the shape of the diaphragm changes substantially in the anteroposterior plane but not in the coronal one. Multivariate regression analysis indicates that the zone of apposition is dependent on both diaphragm shortening and lower rib cage widening with lung inflation, although much more on the first of these two factors. Because of the changes in anteroposterior shape and expansion of the insertional origin at the costal margin with lung inflation, the data therefore suggest that the diaphragm may be more accurately modeled by a ``widening piston'' (Petroll's model) than a simple ``piston in a cylinder'' model. A significant portion of the muscular surface is lung apposed, suggesting that diaphragmatic force has radial vectors in the dome and vectors along the body axis in the zone of apposition. The muscular surface area of the diaphragm decreased linearly by approximately 41% with VL from residual volume to total lung capacity. Diaphragmatic fibers may shorten under physiological conditions more than any other skeletal muscle. The large changes in fiber length combined with limited shape changes with lung inflation suggest that the length-twitch force properties of the diaphragm may be the most important factor for the pressure-generating function of this respiratory muscle in response to bilateral phrenic shocks at different VLs.},

Numerical solution of the potential and magnetic fields for a given electrical source distribution in the human brain is an essential part of electromagnetic source imaging. In this study, the performance of the boundary element method (BEM) is explored with different surface element types. A new BEM formulation is derived that makes use of isoparametric linear, quadratic or cubic elements. The surface integration is performed with Gauss quadrature. The potential fields are solved assuming a concentric three-shell model of the human head for a tangential dipole at different locations. In order to achieve 2% accuracy in potential solutions, the number of quadratic elements is of the order of hundreds. However, with linear elements, this number is of the order of ten thousand. The relative difference measures (RDMs) are obtained for the numerical models that use different element types. The numerical models that employ quadratic and cubic element types provide superior performance over linear elements in terms of accuracy in solutions. Assuming a homogeneous sphere model of the head, the RDMs are also obtained for the three components (radial and tangential) of the magnetic fields. The RDMs obtained for the tangential fields are, in general, much higher than those obtained for the radial fields. Both quadratic and cubic elements provide superior performance compared with linear elements for a wide range of dipole locations.},

A major limitation of the current methods is the inability to accurately relate local electrograms to their spatial orientation. The objective of this study was to present and test the accuracy of a new method for nonfluoroscopic, catheter-based, endocardial mapping.\par
  {\em Methods and Results} The method is based on using a new locatable catheter connected to an endocardial mapping and navigating system. The system uses magnetic technology to accurately determine the location and orientation of the catheter and simultaneously records the local electrogram from its tip. By sampling a plurality of endocardial sites, the system reconstructs the three-dimensional geometry of the chamber, with the electrophysiological information color-coded and superimposed on the anatomy. The accuracy of the system was tested in both in vitro and in vivo studies and was found to be highly reproducible (SD, 0.16±0.02 [mean±SEM] and 0.74±0.13 mm) and accurate (mean errors, 0.42±0.05 and 0.73±0.03 mm). In further studies, electroanatomical mapping of the cardiac chambers was performed in 34 pigs. Both the geometry and activation sequence were repeatable in all pigs.\par
  {\em Conclusions} The new mapping method is highly accurate and reproducible. The ability to combine electrophysiological and spatial information provides a unique tool for both research and clinical electrophysiology. Consequently, the main shortcomings of conventional mapping--namely, prolonged x-ray exposure, low spatial resolution, and the inability to accurately navigate to a predefined site--can all be overcome with this new method.},

Wave propagation in excitable media has been modeled extensively both by continuous partial differential equations and by discrete cellular automata. Cellular automata are desirable because of their intuitive appeal and efficient digital implementation, but until now they have not served as reliable models because they have lacked two essential properties of excitable media. First, traveling waves show dispersion, that is, the speed of wave propagation into a recovering region depends on the time elapsed since the preceding wave passed through that region. Second, wave speed depends on wave front curvature: curved waves travel with normal velocities noticeably different from the plane-wave velocity. These deficiencies of cellular automation models are remedied by revising the classical rules of the excitation and recovery processes. The revised model shows curvature and dispersion effects comparable to those of continuous models, it predicts rotating spiral wave solutions in quantitative accord with the theory of continuous excitable media, and it is parameterized so that the spatial step size of the automation can be adjusted for finer resolution of traveling waves.},

  abstract  = {{\em Background} -- Dispersion of myocardial repolarization supports the development and maintenance of life-threatening arrhythmias. Current noninvasive approaches for detecting substrates with increased dispersion based on ECG measures (eg, QT dispersion) have shown limited success and inconsistencies. The companion article shows that, in contrast, epicardial potentials and derived measures reflect local dispersion of repolarization. Here, using a recently developed ECG imaging method, we evaluate the feasibility of noninvasive reconstruction of such epicardial measures from body-surface ECG data.\par
  {\em Methods and Results} -- Epicardial potentials were recorded with a 224-electrode sock from an open-chest dog during control, regional warming, cooling, and simultaneous adjacent warming and cooling to induce localized changes in myocardial repolarization and regions of increased dispersion. Body-surface potentials were generated from these epicardial potentials in a human torso model. Realistic geometric errors and measurement noise were added to the torso data, which were then used to noninvasively reconstruct epicardial measures of repolarization dispersion (activation recovery intervals [ARIs] and QRST integrals). Repolarization properties were accurately depicted by ECG imaging, including (1) shortened ARIs and increased QRST integrals over the warmed region, (2) prolonged ARIs and decreased QRST integrals over the cooled region, and (3) high gradients of ARIs and QRST integrals over the adjacent warmed and cooled regions.\par
  {\em Conclusions} -- ECG imaging can reconstruct repolarization properties accurately and localize areas of increased dispersion of repolarization in the heart noninvasively. Its clinical significance lies in the possibility of noninvasive risk stratification and in guidance and evaluation of therapy.},

  abstract  = {This study investigated the role of different types of discontinuities in tissue architecture on the spatial distribution of the transmembrane potential. Specifically, we tested the occurrence of so-called ``secondary sources,'' ie, localized hyperpolarizations and depolarizations during the application of extracellular electrical shocks (EESs). Changes in transmembrane potential relative to action potential amplitude ( $\Delta V_m$/APA) were measured in patterned cultures of neonatal rat myocytes, stained with voltage-sensitive dye (RH-237), by optical mapping (96-channel photodiode array, 6- to 30-µm resolution) during the application of EES (field strength, 8 to 22 V/cm; duration, 6 ms). Across narrow cell strands (width, 218±59 [mean±SD] µm), EES applied during the relative refractory period produced a linear and symmetrical profile of $\Delta V_m$/APA (-65±23% maximal hyperpolarization versus +64±15% maximal depolarization). In contrast, the profile of $\Delta V_m$/APA was asymmetrical when EESs were applied during the action potential plateau (-95±32% versus +37±14%). At high magnification, no secondary sources were observed at the borders between cells. In dense isotropic cell monolayers or in monolayers and strands showing intercellular clefts, secondary sources were frequently observed. Intercellular clefts of the size of one to several myocytes were sufficient to produce secondary sources of the same magnitude as those that elicited action potentials in dense cell strands. There was a close correlation between the location of secondary sources during EES and localized conduction slowing during propagation. Thus, densely packed cultured cell strands behave as an electrical continuum with no secondary sources occurring at cell borders. Small intercellular clefts can create secondary sources of sufficient magnitude to exert a stimulatory effect.},

  abstract  = {{\em Background} -- The geometry of the myocardium may influence changes in transmembrane potential (\Delta Vm) during defibrillation. To test this hypothesis, specific nonlinear structures (bifurcations, expansions, and curved strands or ``bends'') were created in patterned cultures of neonatal rat myocytes.\par
  {\em Methods and Results} -- Extracellular field stimuli (EFS; 7 to 11 V/cm field strength) were applied parallel to the strands. Changes in Vm were measured with microscopic resolution using optical mapping techniques. In bifurcations, EFS produced 2 \Delta Vm maxima (so-called secondary sources) at the shoulder of each limb that were separated by a decrease of either hyperpolarization or depolarization at the insertion of the stem strand. In expansions, EFS produced a significant decrease in \Delta Vm at the insertion site of the expansion compared with the \Delta Vm maxima measured at the lateral borders. In 50% of experiments, tertiary sources of opposite polarity appeared in the strand due to local electrotonic currents. New action potentials were propagated from the sites of \Delta Vm maxima located at the lateral borders of the expansions. In bends, the strand oriented in parallel to the field dominated electrotonically and partially cancelled the sources produced by the perpendicular segment.\par
  {\em Conclusions} -- In electrically well-coupled nonlinear structures, EFS produced changes in Vm at resistive boundaries that were determined by the electrotonic interaction between sources of different, direction-dependent strength. In addition, the interaction between localized secondary sources at nonlinear boundaries generated local current circuits, which gave rise to further changes in Vm (tertiary sources).},

This study validated a new noncontact multielectrode array catheter and accompanying analysis system to provide electroanatomic mapping of the entire left ventricular (LV) endocardium during a single beat.\par
  {\em Methods and Results} -- A 9F 64-electrode balloon array catheter with an inflated size of 1.8x4.6 cm was used to simultaneously record electrical potentials generated by the heart and locate a standard electrophysiology (EP) catheter within the same chamber. By use of the recorded location of the EP-catheter tip, LV geometry was determined. Array potentials served as inputs to a high-order boundary-element method to produce 3360 potential points on the endocardial surface translatable into electrograms or color-coded activation maps. Three methods of validation were used: (1) driven electrodes in an in vitro tank were located; (2) waveforms generated from the array catheter were compared with catheter contact waveforms in canine LV; and (3) sites of local LV endocardial activation were located and marked with radiofrequency lesions. Tank testing located a driven electrode to within 2.33±0.44 mm. Correlation of timing and morphology of computed versus contact electrograms was 0.966. Radiofrequency lesions marked 17 endocardial pacing sites to within 4.0±3.2 mm.
  {\em Conclusions} -- This new system provides anatomically accurate endocardial isopotential mapping during a single cardiac cycle. The locator component enabled placement of a separate EP catheter to any site within the mapped chamber.},

  abstract  = {Cardiac fibrillation (spontaneous, asynchronous contractions of cardiac muscle fibres) is the leading cause of death in the industrialized world, yet it is not clear how it occurs. It has been debated whether or not fibrillation is a random phenomenon. There is some determinism during fibrillation, perhaps resulting from rotating waves of electrical activity. Here we present a new algorithm that markedly reduces the amount of data required to depict the complex spatiotemporal patterns of fibrillation. We use a potentiometric dye and video imaging, to record the dynamics of transmembrane potentials at many sites during fibrillation. Transmembrane signals at each site exhibit a strong periodic component centred near 8 Hz. This periodicity is seen as an attractor in two-dimensional-phase space and each site can be represented by its phase around the attractor. Spatial phase maps at each instant reveal the `sources' of fibrillation in the form of topological defects, or phase singularities, at a few sites. Using our method of identifying phase singularities, we can elucidate the mechanisms for the formation and termination of these singularities, and represent an episode of fibrillation by locating singularities. Our results indicate an unprecedented amount of temporal and spatial organization during cardiac fibrillation.},

  abstract  = {{\em Introduction:} Little is known about how the amplitude and timing of transmembrane current pulses affect transmembrane potential ($V_m$) and action potential duration (APD) in isolated myocytes.\par
  {\em Methods and Results:} Ten ventricular myocytes were isolated from five rabbit hearts. Each cell was paced at an S1 cycle length of 250 msec, and S2 pulses of 10-msec duration were delivered at various strengths and time intervals. For all S2 strengths (0.2 to 1.5 nA), the magnitude of changes in $V_m$ did not depend on polarity during the plateau, but were larger for depolarizing pulses during phase 3 repolarization. However, the magnitude of changes in APD varied with polarity during the entire action potential for strengths ranging from 0.5 to 1.5 nA. Greater changes in APD occurred for hyperpolarizing pulses during the plateau and depolarizing pulses during phase 3. In addition, we used a cardiac phase variable to quantify the current threshold for regenerative depolarization and repolarization as a function of prestimulus $V_m$. Regenerative depolarization occurred during phase 3 repolarization, and its current threshold was less than that required for regenerative repolarization that occurred during the plateau. These data were compared to computer simulations in a patch of membrane represented by Luo-Rudy dynamic kinetics, and the results were qualitatively similar, including the higher threshold for regenerative repolarization compared to regenerative depolarization.\par
  {\em Conclusion:} This characterization of the nonlinear response of isolated cells to transmembrane current, including phase resetting, should aid in understanding the mechanisms of defibrillation because shockinduced changes in $V_m$ and APD have been implicated as important factors in determining defibrillation success.},

  abstract  = {{\em Background:} Epicardial excitation sequences, recovery sequences, and potential distributions are recorded from patients during surgery and from animals in the research laboratory for a variety of purposes. During such recordings, a portion of the cardiac surface is exposed to air, and the remainder of the epicardial surface variably is in contact with conductive tissue. No systematic studies document the degree to which these different conditions affect measured excitation times, potential distributions, and/or the configuration of epicardial electrograms.\par
  {\em Methods and Results:} Epicardial potential distribution was recorded from five isolated, perfused hearts using a 64-unipolar- lead sock. Data were recorded first with the heart suspended in air and then with the heart immersed in a heated tank filled sequentially to full and half-full levels with conductive Tyrode's solution and then NaCl-sucrose solution. These solutions had resistivity less than and more than that of blood, respectively, and air was assumed to have infinite resistivity. Epicardial potentials were recorded from two hearts before removal from the chest, both with and without a latex sheet insulating the heart from the pericardial cradle. Amplitude of recorded potentials from both intact and isolated hearts was markedly higher when the heart was surrounded by an insulating medium, but locations of positive and negative regions were less affected by surrounding medium. Isochrone activation maps calculated using the minimum derivative of the QRS (intrinsic deflection) were not affected by the conductivity of media surrounding the heart.\par
  {\em Conclusions:} The present study provides evidence that isochrone maps recorded at surgery are not distorted by exposure of the cardiac surface to insulating air. Results suggest that epicardial isochrones recorded during cardiac surgery could be used in patients to assess the accuracy of ``inverse'' procedures that noninvasively compute epicardial electrograms and isochrones from body surface potentials.},

QRS isopotential maps and QRS isointegral maps derived from body surface isopotential maps have also been correlated with left ventricular pacing sites with the same objective. The comparison process used is subjective and only semiquantitative. Improved accuracy of catheter placement may improve success rates of ablation therapy.\par
  {\em METHODS AND RESULTS:} This animal study was performed to determine the spatial resolution with which left ventricular pacing sites could be distinguished by body surface isopotential mapping. Potentials were recorded from 64 evenly spaced thoracic leads. Hexapolar or octapolar pacing catheters with 2-mm interelectrode spacing were placed percutaneously in the left ventricle in each of six dogs, and bipolar endocardial pacing was performed using each pair of adjacent electrodes. QRS isopotential maps of each pacing site for each catheter placement were cross-correlated by computer. Difference maps for each pair of pacing sites were calculated lead by lead and time instant by time instant, and root-mean-square voltage differences were calculated. Results indicated that correlation coefficients and root-mean-square error of voltage differences monotonically decrease and increase, respectively, with stimulus site separation. Both measures were significantly different (P < .05) for separations of 4 mm or more.\par
  {\em CONCLUSIONS:} A method of quantitative comparison of body surface potential maps can be used in normal hearts to localize ventricular pacing sites within a 4-mm range. The method may have utility in determining potential ablation sites for therapy of ventricular tachycardia or preexcitation syndromes.},

  abstract  = {In addition to formidable theoretical obstacles that a proposed solution to the inverse electrocardiology problem must overcome, there are great practical difficulties in establishing its accuracy in actual clinical application. However, the recent appearance of two fundamentally independent treatments of the inverse problem raises the possibility that they may be used in tandem to help establish their individual accuracy. Thus, if the two methods give incompatible results in application then one of the methods must be inaccurate. Conversely, if the two methods give compatible results then the accuracy of both methods is supported (for the particular quantities measured) subject only to the validity of the assumptions common to both methods. We have compared results from the application of a quantitative ``integral equations based'' method with that of a qualitative ``differential topology inspired'' approach in three healthy volunteers. The output examined consists of measurements of the times of appearance of epicardial sources (depolarization wavefront breakthroughs) and sinks of the ventricular surface activation map. The extent of agreement on source/sink times between the methods was consistent with the resolution limits imposed by noise and discrete sampling on derivatives of the electrocardiogram. When events defined by the integral method occurring within 2 ms of each other are grouped together (and their times averaged), the two methods agreed on source/sink times to within 3 ms except in two instances where they differed by 5 ms. The measurements made by the two methods were found to be highly correlated (R = 0.95). While the quantitative method alone rests on a variety of modeling and procedural assumptions, the only assumption common to both methods is the uniform dipole layer hypothesis. Thus, subject to this single assumption, one may infer the accuracy of the quantitative method in healthy individuals for epicardial source/sink times. On the other hand, coupling with the far more detailed quantitative method allows further useful characterization of the output of the qualitative method. In particular, this study provides convincing evidence that the major deflections of the spatial velocity electrocardiogram are coupled to particular epicardial sources and sinks, as has been previously conjectured on theoretical grounds. This raises the possibility of bedside evaluation of these epicardial events.},

Using an argument from differential geometry, which allows the integral equation approach to be bypassed, it is shown that the critical points of this map can be localized on the heart surface from the body surface potential in a manner fully consistent with the oblique dipole layer model. Thus, in principle, a realistic and useful image-like output is possible in a limited way even without explicit information regarding conductivity anisotropy.

Significant inaccuracies are introduced by such methods (on the order of 50% error relative to the actual map), due to imposition of the regularizing functionals. It has been previously shown that the generator of topological changes in epicardial potential maps during ventricular activation is of much lower order than the epicardial maps themselves, yet sufficiently constrains the full ventricular surface activation mapping problem so as to obviate the need for further regularization. The mathematical formalism for reconstructing this generator has previously been presented under the assumption of negligible depolarization wavefront thickness, and requires identification and processing of ``step discontinuities'' predicted to occur in body surface potential derivatives. Using principal component analysis and spatial averaging methods, we have examined this fundamental prediction of the formalism in the context of a nonzero depolarization wavefront thickness (leading to prediction of dominant body surface potential derivative deflections with rise times comparable to those of ventricular electrogram intrinsic deflections). Studies of the body surface potential data obtained in three normal subjects supports the predictions of the theory, thereby suggesting the possible usefulness of the approach as an alternative to traditional regularization methods.},

However, all prior formulations of this problem have remained ill-posed, and the best way to utilize these constraints has been unclear. By making proper use of the timing information, we show that the inverse electrocardiography problem (for calculation of ventricular surface activation isochrones) is formally well-posed under anisotropic bidomain conditions and the assumption that ventricular muscle action potential phase 0 is a step discontinuity. In practical terms, this implies that non-regularized stable activation map solutions are possible if correlates of derived body surface potential derivative discontinuity times can be identified from the noisy analog signals, and only a small number of ventricular surface activation function extrema occur during a unit of time resolution defined by phase zero duration over the spatial extent of a bidomain point. We include a quasi-realistic numerical example illustrating the ease with which the extrema of the endocardial and epicardial activation maps are computed via Jump Maps derived from body surface potentials (this being the crucial step in rendering images of ventricular surface activation in this approach). The efficient signal processing algorithm used to accomplish this task is well suited to the setting of multiple extrema occurring during overlapping phase zero time intervals.},

  abstract  = {The essential difficulty of the source-imaging problem in electrocardiology is that the data (body surface potentials) depend continuously on the properties of complex uniquely determined equivalent sources (e.g., epicardial potentials) while such sources do not depend continuously on the data (precluding utility of direct inversion of the operator relating sources and data). This is in distinction to the standard digital tomographic imaging problems in radiology, which superficially resemble the electrocardiographic imaging problem in their requirement for solution of a linear integral equation. From the mathematical standpoint, the electrocardiographic imaging problem requires that an operator with a continuous inverse be constructed from the original operator. This may be accomplished either by slightly perturbing the original operator (the regularization approach), or by performing a calculation on the data (based on inherent source evolution singularities) which allows restriction of the admissible solution domain to a compact set (the topological approach). An understanding of the mathematical questions fundamental to this imaging problem is helpful in assessing its present status and in identifying promising directions for the development of a clinically useful technique.},

This result has particular implications for treatment of the bioelectric/biomagnetic source imaging problems, where the characteristic need to perform such a deconvolution has been previously handled by producing an individually regularized solution to the above equation for each $t$ in a collection of times spanning an interval of interest, or by inadequate augmentation of the dimensionality of the regularization parameter.

  abstract  = {This paper provides an optimal mechanism for the introduction of temporal constraints into linear imaging formulations of the inverse electroencephalography problem. The method is based on derivation of a ``virtual-SVD,'' an extension of generalized singular value decomposition to the setting of random matrices. Surprisingly, the formalism is superior, in principle, to standard regularization methods even in the absence of known temporal constraints. Investigation of this basic temporally unconstrained setting was undertaken to illustrate the application of the method, and as a necessary first step in its systematic evaluation. Although abstract simulations demonstrate superior accuracy for the virtual-SVD method as compared with standard methods, investigation of a particular realistic simulation involving spatiotemporally distributed temporal lobe interictal spikes indicates that significant improvement in solution estimate quality under temporally unconstrained conditions may be limited to a very narrow range of the signal-to-noise ratio (particularly in the context of a markedly row-deficient transfer matrix). These results underline the prospective importance of investigation of the efficacy and feasibility of application of temporal constraints (such as those resulting from knowledge of the general time series format of epilepsy associated wave forms, evoked potentials, etc.) within the derived formalism.},

The transfer coefficients relating the individual dipoles to the torso surface potentials, as well as the body surface potential maps, the vectorcardiogram, and the 12-lead electrocardiogram resulting due to normal activation of the heart model, were calculated for each of the following torso conditions: homogeneous, homogeneous + skeletal muscle layer, homogeneous + muscle layer + lungs, and homogeneous + muscle layer + lungs + intraventricular blood masses. The effects of each inhomogeneity were deduced by comparing results before and after its inclusion. For individual dipole transfer coefficients we confirm the validity of the ``Brody effect,'' whereby the high conductivity blood masses augment radially oriented dipoles and diminish tangentially oriented ones. With regard to the vectorcardiogram , the electrocardiogram, and the body surface potential maps, the major qualitative effects were an augmentation of the head-to-foot component of the vectorcardiogram due to the lungs, and a smoothening of notches in the electrocardiogram (temporal filtering) and of isopotential contours in the body surface potential maps (spatial filtering) with a consequent loss of information, due to the blood masses, muscle layer, and, to a lesser extent, the lungs. Besides the above qualitative effects of the inhomogeneities, there were also large quantitative effects on the surface potentials, namely, magnitude increases due to the blood masses and magnitude decreases due to the muscle layer, that--if unaccounted for--could compromise the inverse solution of these potentials for the cardiac dipole sources.},

This site was first estimated to be at one of eight locations around the atrioventricular ring, from the patient's QRS and ST segment body surface potential maps, as has been described by others. Next, SMD parameters were calculated during the delta wave so as to approximate, on a numerical torso model, the patient's body surface potential map. Visualization of the calculated position of the SMD around the atrioventricular ring was done by projecting it on a plane parallel to this ring. This plane corresponded to the most basal transverse section of a heart model present in the torso model. One limitation was the use of non-varying heart and torso models for all patients. As a result, the SMD technique lacked the precision to separate accessory pathway sites into eight atrioventricular locations. However it was capable of distinguishing between patients belonging to the larger classes of right-sided, posterior, and left-sided preexcitation, formed by combining adjacent atrioventricular accessory pathway locations. With more accurate heart and torso models, it may be possible to increase SMD resolution so as to locate accessory pathway sites deep within the heart. This would represent an advantage over the surface potential map approach which only identifies the site of earliest epicardial breakthrough associated with the accessory pathway.},

The basic volume-conductor equations and the different techniques used to solve them, the bidomain characterization of the myocardium, propagation in cardiac tissue, and equivalent source formulations for the electrical activity of the heart are all reviewed. Following this, a review of heart models conceived for cardiac rhythm simulations is presented. These models do not represent the heart geometry accurately, and hence ECG simulations with such models are, at best, first approximations. Next, realistic-geometry heart models, but without propagation, are described. Since the activation isochrones in such models are fixed, they are essentially suited only for the study of normal activation or for ischemia and infarction simulations. Finally, realistic-geometry models which use element-to-element propagation are described. Because of their ability to alter activation patterns, such models may also be used to study conduction disturbances and arrhythmias. Surface potential simulations realized with both types of realistic-geometry models are also reviewed. The paper concludes with a section on heart models of the future.},

  abstract  = {This paper describes a two-dimensional cardiac propagation model based on the finite volume method (FVM). This technique, originally derived and applied within the filed of computational fluid dynamics, is well suited to the investigation of conduction in cardiac electrophysiology. Specifically, the FVM permits the consideration of propagation in a realistic structure, subject to arbitrary fiber orientations and regionally defined properties. In this application of the FVM, an arbitrarily shaped domain is decomposed into a set of constitutive quadrilaterals. Calculations are performed in a computational space, in which the quadrilaterals are all represented simply as squares. Results are related to their physical-space equivalents by means of a transformation matrix. The method is applied to a number of cases. First, large-scale propagation is considered, in which a magnetic resonance-imaged cardiac cross-section serves as the governing geometry. Next, conduction is examined in the presence of an isthmus formed by the microvasculature in a slice of papillary muscle tissue. Under ischemic conditions, the safety factor for propagation is seen to be related to orientation of the fibers within the isthmus. Finally, conduction is studied in the presence of an inexcitable obstacle and a curved fiber field. This example illustrates the dramatic influence of the complex orientation of the fibers on the resulting activation pattern. The FVM provides a means of accurately modeling the cardiac structure and can help bridge the gap between computation and experiment in cardiac electrophysiology.},

The present work describes a finite volume-based computer model of human atrial activation and current flow to complement these studies. Unlike previous representations, the model is three-dimensional, incorporating both the left and right atria and the major muscle bundles of the atria, including the crista terminalis, pectinate muscles, limbus of the fossa ovalis, and Bachmann's bundle. The bundles are represented as anisotropic structures with fiber directions aligned with the bundle axes. Conductivities are assigned to the model to give realistic local conduction velocities within the bundles and bulk tissue. Results from simulations demonstrate the role of the bundles in a normal sinus rhythm and also reveal the patterns of activation in the septum, where experimental mapping has been extremely challenging. To validate the model, the simulated normal activation sequence and conduction velocities at various locations are compared with experimental observations and data. The model is also used to investigate paced activation, and a mechanism of the relative lengthening of left versus right stimulation is presented. Owing to both the realistic geometry and the bundle structures, the model can be used for further analysis of the normal activation sequence and to examine abnormal conduction, including flutter.},

A heterogeneous volume conductor model of an adult male with a resolution of approximately 6 mm3 and 30 segmented tissue types was used along with the admittance method and successive over-relaxation to calculate the voltage distribution throughout the torso and head as a function of time. From this time-domain voltage description, values of [E(t)] and [J(t)] were obtained, allowing for maximum values to be found within the given tissues of interest. Frequency analysis was then used to solve for [E(f)] and [J(f)] in the various organs, so that average, minimum and maximum values within specific bandwidths (0-40, 40-70 and 70-100 Hz) could be analysed. A comparison was made between the computed results and measured data from both EKG waveforms and isopotential surface maps for validation, with good agreement in both amplitude and shape between the computed and measured results. These computed endogenous fields were then compared with exogenous fields induced in the body from a 60 Hz high-voltage power line and a 60 Hz uniform magnetic field of 1 mT directed from the front to the back of the body. The high-voltage power line EMFs and 1 mT magnetic field were used as 'bench' marks for comparison with several safety guidelines for power frequency (50/60 Hz) EMF exposures. The endogenous electric fields and current densities in most of the tissues (except for organs in close proximity to the heart, for example lungs, liver, etc) in the frequency band 40-70 Hz were found to be considerably smaller, between 5% and 10%, than those induced in the human body by the electric and magnetic fields generated by the 60 Hz sources described above.},

A two-sphere homogeneous volume conductor model, where the inner sphere represents the epicardium and the outer sphere the body surface, was used.  Radial and tangential current dipoles were used to approximate localized wavefronts propagating from the endocardium to the epicardium, and ectopic myocardial activities.  The epicardial potential distribution was reconstructed from the body surface Laplacians with the aid of the Tikhonov zero-order regularization technique, which then was compared with the results obtained from the body surface potentials using the same regularization scheme.  The two inverse solutions were compared qualitatively via visual inspection of the reconstructed epicardial potential maps, and quantitatively by examining relative errors and correlation coefficients between the  true  and the reconstructed epicardial potentials.  Both qualitative and quantitative results indicate that the surface Laplacians play a positive role in improving the ill-posed nature of the bioelectric inverse problem, which would enhance our capability of reconstructing important epicardial events such as extrema in the epicardial potential distribution.  The present theoretical study suggests that the Laplacian-based inverse imaging technique may have important applications to epicardial inverse imaging and other bioelectric inverse imaging.},

We propose to image the three-dimensional (3-D) cardiac bioelectric source distribution from body-surface electrocardiograms. Cardiac electrical sources were modeled by a current dipole distribution throughout the entire myocardium, and estimated by using the Laplacian weighted minimum norm (LWMN) algorithm from body-surface potentials. The estimated inverse solution of the current distribution was further improved by using a recursive weighting strategy for localized sources, such as origins of cardiac arrhythmias. Computer simulations were conducted to test the feasibility of the proposed approach by using a 3-D ventricle model embedded in a realistically shaped torso model. The boundary element method was used to solve the forward problem from assumed cardiac sources to the body-surface potentials. Two testing dipoles were placed in the left and right ventricles, simulating the early activation associated with ventricular arrhythmias. The LWMN inverse solution showed an equivalent source distribution over the entity of both ventricles, with spread areas of activity overlying the positions of the testing dipoles. The sharpened inverse image provides well-localized focal sources near the testing dipole positions. In summary, the present computer simulation suggests that the proposed 3-D cardiac current source imaging and localization approach appears to be a promising candidate for localizing and imaging sites of origins of cardiac activation.},

One approach that has gained considerable favor in recent years views the tissue not as a discrete structure, but rather as two coupled, continuous domains: one for the intracellular space and the other for the interstitial space. For convenience, the averaged potentials and currents in both domains are defined at every point in space. The structure is partially preserved by assigning a conductivity tensor at each point. One advantage of using this space-averaged model is that the governing equations for the electric fields can be described by partial differential equations that on occasion lead to analytical solutions. This formal treatment of cardiac tissue as two coupled continua is referred to as the bidomain model.

This simulation study investigated the effects of dynamic gap junctions on both the shape and conduction velocity of a propagating action potential. The dynamic gap junction model is based on that described by Vogel and Weingart ({\em J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998, 510:177-189}) for the voltage- and time-dependent conductance changes measured in cell pairs. The model assumes that the conductive gap junction channels have four conformational states. The gap junction model was used to couple 300 cells in a linear strand with membrane dynamics of the cells defined by the Luo-Rudy I model. The results show that, when the cells are tightly coupled (6700 channels), little change occurs in the gap junction resistance during propagation. Thus, for tight coupling, there are negligible differences in the waveshape and propagation velocity when comparing the dynamic and static gap junction representations. For poor coupling (85 channels), the gap junction resistance increases 33 M \Omega  during propagation. This transient change in resistance resulted in increased transjunctional conduction delays, changes in action potential upstroke, and block of conduction at a lower junction resting resistance relative to a static gap junction model. The results suggest that the dynamics of the gap junction enhance cellular decoupling as a possible protective mechanism of isolating injured cells from their neighbors.},

  {\em Methods and Results:} In our simulation, the bidomain model represents the electrical properties of the tissue and the Beeler-Reuter model represents the membrane kinetics. Quatrefoil reentry is initiated by S1-S2 stimulation, and then a third stimulus S3 is applied at different intervals after S2. All stimuli are applied through the same unipolar electrode. For some S2-S3 intervals, the S2 and S3 wavefronts interact destructively, terminating reentry (protective zones). For other S2-S3 intervals, S2 and S3 wavefronts interact constructively, and reentry continues. Protective zones appear recurrently, with approximately the period of the S2 reentrant circuit. The protective zones are wider for anodal stimulation than for cathodal stimulation.\par
  {\em Conclusion:} Virtual electrodes, break excitation, and S2-S3 timing all play important roles in determining the electrical response of the tissue.},

  abstract  = {Interactions of electrogenic sodium-calcium exchange, calcium channel and sarcoplasmic reticulum in the mammalian heart have been explored by simulation of extracellular calcium transients measured with tetramethylmurexide in rabbit atrium. The approach has been to use the simplest possible formulations of these mechanisms, which together with a minimum number of additional mechanisms allow reconstruction of action potentials, intracellular calcium transients and extracellular calcium transients. A 3:1 sodium-calcium exchange stoichiometry is assumed. Calcium-channel inactivation is assumed to take place by a voltage-dependent mechanism, which is accelerated by a rise in intracellular calcium; intracellular calcium release becomes a major physiological regulator of calcium influx via calcium channels. A calcium release mechanism is assumed, which is both calcium- and voltage-sensitive, and which undergoes prolonged inactivation. 200 $\mu $M cytosolic calcium buffer is assumed. For most simulations only instantaneous potassium conductances are simulated so as to study the other mechanisms independently of time- and calcium-dependent outward current. Thus, the model reconstructs extracellular calcium transients and typical action-potential configuration changes during steady-state and non-steady-state stimulation from the mechanisms directly involved in trans-sarcolemmal calcium movements. The model predicts relatively small trans-sarcolemmal calcium movements during regular stimulation (ca. 2 $\mu $mol kg$^{-1}$ fresh mass per excitation); calcium current is fully activated within 2 ms of excitation, inactivation is substantially complete within 30 ms, and sodium-calcium exchange significantly resists repolarization from approximately -30 mV. Net calcium movements many times larger are possible during non-steady-state stimulation. Long action potentials at premature excitations or after inhibition of calcium release can be supported almost exclusively by calcium current (net calcium influx 5-30 $\mu $mol kg$^{-1}$ fresh mass); action potentials during potentiated post-stimulatory contractions can be supported almost exclusively by sodium-calcium exchange (net calcium efflux 4-20 $\mu $mol kg$^{-1}$ fresh mass). Large calcium movements between the extracellular space and the sarcoplasmic reticulum can take place through the cytosol with virtually no contractile activation. The simulations provide integrated explanations of electrical activity, contractile function and trans-sarcolemmal calcium movements, which were outside the explanatory range of previous models.},

This variability is caused by geometrical as well as by physiological factors.  In this study, the relative contribution of the geometrical factors is estimated.  In addition a method aimed at correcting for these factors is described.  First, a measure (RV) for quantifying the overall variability is presented, and for healthy individuals its value is estimated as 0.52.  Next, based on a simulation study using the individual (heart-lung-torso) geometry of 25 subjects, the variability caused by geometrical factors is estimated as 0.40, indicating that in healthy subjects the RV for healthy individuals resulting from electrophysiology is of the order of 0.33.  In an evaluation of the correction procedure, applied to realistic, simulated body surface potentials, it is shown that RV caused by geometrical factors can be reduced from 0.40 to 0.06.  When applying the correction procedure to measured ECG data no reduction of the RV value could be demonstrated.  These results indicate that the involved procedure of the inverse computation of a cardiac equivalent source, at the present time, is of insufficient quality to cash in on the substantial reduction of RV values from 0.52 down to 0.33 that might be obtainable.},

A probe constructed from optical fibers is used to deliver excitation light and collect fluorescence from seven positions, each 1 mm apart, through the left ventricle wall of the rabbit heart. Excitation is provided by the 488-nm line of a water-cooled argon-ion laser. The fluorescence of the voltage-sensitive dye di-4-ANEPPS from each tissue site is split at 600 nm and imaged onto separate photodiodes for later signal ratioing. The optics and electronics are easily expandable to accommodate multiple optical probes.

  abstract  = {An approach to the inverse problem of electrocardiography that involves an estimation of the electric potentials (double-layer equivalent sources) on the heart's epicardial surface from the electrocardiographic potentials that are measurable on the body surface has received considerable attention.  This report deals with a heretofore unexplored extension of this approach, one that yields, in addition to the electric potentials on the epicardial surface, the normal components of their gradients (single-layer equivalent sources).  We show that this formulation has at least three advantages over the formulation in terms of epicardial potentials alone: (1) single-layer equivalent sources, which reflect the flow of current across the epicardial surface, are well suited for the imaging of regional ischemia and infarction; (2) the transfer matrix linking the epicardial and body-surface potentials for this formulation is less ill conditioned than that for the formulation in terms of potentials alone; (3) the input vector for inverse calculations consists of spatially filtered (rather than directly measured and therefore noisy) body-surface potentials.  To establish the feasibility of this new formulation of the inverse problem and to compare it with the formulation in terms of potentials alone, we used a realistically shaped boundary-element model of the human torso.  By calculating singular values of the transfer matrices for this model, we found that one for the new formulation is less ill conditioned.  We then directly calculated epicardial and body-surface potentials for a single dipole located centrally and for three simultaneously active dipoles located eccentrically in the torso's heart region and used these results to test three methods that are prerequisites of a successful inverse solution: Tikhonov regularization, linearly constrained least squares, and an L-curve method.  The feasibility of the new formulation was demonstrated by the fact that the method based on the linearly constrained least squares improved on overregularized Tikhonov solutions over a wide range of regularization parameters, and it yielded solutions that were more accurate than the best-possible Tikhonov solutions.  Moreover, the L-curve solution procedure, which requires no {\em a priori} information about the solution, yielded slightly underregularized, but accurate, estimates for the optimal regularization parameter and the corresponding best-possible Tikhonov solution.  Our results also showed that replacing--in the interest of computational economy--quadrature formulas for the planar triangles with various approximate formulas for the nodes of the model reduces the accuracy of the inverse solution.},

An inhomogeneous three-concentric-sphere head model was used in the present simulation study to represent the head volume conductor. An equivalent dipole layer was used to model brain electric sources and estimated from the scalp potentials. Various noise conditions were simulated and the parametric projection filter was compared with standard regularization procedures such as the truncated singular value decomposition (TSVD) and the Tikhonov regularization (TKNV). The present simulation results suggest that the proposed method performs better than that of commonly used inverse regularization techniques, such as the general inverse using the TSVD and the TKNV, when the correlation between the original source distribution and the noise distribution is low, and performs similarly when the correlation is high. A method for determining the optimum regularization parameter, which can be applied to parametric inverse techniques, has also been developed.},

Our model features an anatomically accurate geometry and an anisotropy due to transmural fibre rotation, that were reconstructed with a spatial resolution of 0.5 mm. It simulates the electrotonic interactions of cardiac cells by solving a nonlinear parabolic partial differential equation, but it behaves as a cellular automaton when the transmembrane potential exceeds the threshold value. We successfully validated our model by comparing the simulated activation sequences--described by isochronal maps, epicardial potential maps and body surface potential maps--with the measured sequences of epicardial and body surface maps reported in the literature. By systematically pacing the left ventricular and right ventricular endocardial surfaces in our ventricular model, we generated a database of 155 QRS-integral maps, which provides a high-resolution reference frame for localizing distinct endocardial pacing sites. This database promises to be a useful tool in improving the performance of catheter pace mapping used in combination with body surface potential mapping. Overall, the results demonstrate that our computer model of the human ventricular myocardium is well suited for complementing a database of QRS-integral maps obtained during clinical pace mapping and can help enhance the efficacy of the ablative treatment of ventricular arrhythmias.},

Activation sequences were elicited at various intramural depths, and maps were calculated throughout a 60 ms sequence. The simulated maps closely resembled those measured by others in the canine heart. During the early stages of activation, a typical map featuring a central minimum flanked by two maxima emerged, with the axis joining these extrema approximately parallel to the fibers near the pacing site, and the axis joining the maxima rotated in the same direction as the fibers for different pacing depths; for endocardial and subendocardial pacing this map changed into one with an oblong positive area. During the later stages of activation, the positive areas of the maps expanded and rotated with the transmural fiber rotation. In concurrence with experiments, we saw a fragmentation and asymmetry of expanding and rotating positive areas. The latter features-apparently caused by the interface between the compacta and trabeculata, variable local thickness of the wall, or local undulations of the vetricular surface-could not be reproduced by more idealized, slab models.},

The purpose of this study was to systematically quantify over what distance adjacent sites in the right ventricular (RV) and left ventricular (LV) epicardium and LV endocardium could be distinguished by inspecting morphological features of QRS isointegral maps using statistical methods. We investigated the spatial resolution of QRS isointegral maps by means of an anatomically accurate computer model of the human ventricular myocardium that incorporates a bidomain model for simulating the realistic activation sequences and the oblique dipole model in combination with the boundary element method for calculating extracardiac potentials. In this model, we initiated activation sequences at a total of 183 epicardial and 75 LV endocardial pacing sites, positioned in three levels (basal, middle, and apical). For each of the 258 pacing sites, we calculated a set of 10 QRS isointegral maps with added Gaussian noise at 117 leads (covering the anterior and posterior torso) and at 32 leads (covering only the anterior torso), respectively. Sets of maps were then cross correlated and root-mean-square (RMS) values of difference maps were calculated for all possible pairs of pacing sites on the same level. We applied the nonparametric unpaired Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and defined the spatial resolution as the pacing site separation at which the differences in correlation coefficients and RMS differences were significant (level P < .05). We observed significant differences in maps when the distances between pacing sites were on average (+/- SD) greater than 4.3 +/- 1.0 mm. In more than 90% of pacing sites, the significant differences in maps were observed within 4 mm even when using a 32-lead mapping system. The findings of our study provide theoretical evidence that QRS isointegral maps may offer noninvasive means for preinterventional planning of the ablative treatment in localizing both endocardial and epicardial sites of origin of VT.},

  abstract  = {Recent studies have demonstrated that electrocardiographic imaging (ECGI) is a novel noninvasive modality for exploring the spread of electrical activation within the ventricular wall. In this study, our goal was to explore the ability of ECGI in reconstructing epicardial potentials and electrograms in the ventricles damaged by localized necroses (<2 cm^2). An anatomical model of the human ventricular myocardium was used to simulate activation sequences initiated at 428 epicardial and endocardial pacing sites distributed over the right ventricular and left ventricular free walls. From these realistic sequences, we simulated extracardiac potentials at epicardial (202 sites) and torso surfaces (352 sites) using boundary element model of the human torso. ECGI in terms of the L-curve was applied to compute epicardial potentials and unipolar electrograms (202 sites). Inversely computed electrograms correlated well with those simulated by an anatomical model (r > 0.9 at 68% of sites). Specifically, ECGI accurately reconstructed the following features that have been observed during measurements on the exposed canine hearts: (a) an epicardial potential pattern with a central minimum and two maxima, with the minimum positioned above the pacing site; (b) a complete transient loss of one of the positive areas in the epicardial potential pattern when the necrosis was located subepicardially; and (c) a transient gap in the expanding positive areas of the epicardial potential pattern when the necrosis was located intramurally or subendocardially. Findings of our study indicate that ECGI provides detailed reconstruction of patterns of myocardial activation in the presence of localized necroses and may be useful in the assessment of arrhythmogenic substrate in the clinical setting.},

  abstract  = {Functional properties of the myocardium are mediated by the tissue structure. Consequently, proper physiological studies and modeling necessitate a precise knowledge of the fiber orientation. Magnetic resonance (MR) diffusion tensor imaging techniques have been used as a nondestructive means to characterize tissue fiber structure; however, the descriptions so far have been mostly qualitative. This study presents a direct, quantitative comparison of high-resolution MR fiber mapping and histology measurements in a block of excised canine myocardium. Results show an excellent correspondence of the measured fiber angles not only on a point-by-point basis (average difference of -2.30 ± 0.98°, n = 239) but also in the transmural rotation of the helix angles (average correlation coefficient of 0.942 ± 0.008 with average false-positive probability of 0.004 ± 0.001, n = 24). These data strongly support the hypothesis that the eigenvector of the largest MR diffusion tensor eigenvalue coincides with the orientation of the local myocardial fibers and underscore the potential of MR imaging as a noninvasive, three-dimensional modality to characterize tissue fiber architecture.},

The inhomogeneities of the torso are modeled as eccentric spherical volumes with both the curvature and the rotation features of cardiac fibers incorporated in the myocardial region. The numerical computation of the finite element bidomain myocardial model is validated by a semianalytic solution. The simulations show that rotation of fiber orientation through the depth of the myocardial wall changes the pattern of polarization and decreases the amount of cardiac tissue polarized compared to the idealized analytic model with no fiber rotation incorporated. The TMP induced by transthoracic and transvenous defibrillation fields are calculated and visualized. The TMP is quantified by a continuous measure of the percentage of myocardial mass above a potential gradient threshold. Using this measure, the root mean square differences in TMP distribution produced by reversing the electrode polarity for anterior-posterior and transvenous electrode configurations are 13.6 and 28.6%, respectively. These results support the claim that a bidomain model of the heart predicts a change of defibrillation threshold with reversed electrode polarity.},

  abstract  = {{\em Background} -- It has been reported that triphasic defibrillation waveforms cause less myocardial injury than biphasic waveforms. This study compared the defibrillation thresholds (DFTs) of triphasic and biphasic waveforms.\par
  {\em Methods and Results} -- DFTs were determined for a transvenous lead system and a 300-µF-capacitor defibrillator. In 8 pigs (group 1), DFTs were determined for 5 triphasic waveforms with tilts of 80%, 83%, and 86% and for 1 biphasic waveform. DFTs were determined in another 8 pigs (group 2) for 2 triphasic and 4 biphasic waveforms with tilts of 43%, 49%, and 56%. In both groups, a biphasic waveform from a 140-µF-capacitor defibrillator was also evaluated, and both shock polarities were tested for each waveform. In group 1, with the 300-µF-capacitor defibrillator, the leading-edge voltage and energy stored at DFT were significantly lower for triphasic waveforms with phase-duration ratios of 50/33/17 and an anode at the right ventricular electrode for phase 1 than for biphasic waveforms (P<0.001). In group 2, the stored energy of triphasic waveforms with 56% and 49% tilt was significantly lower than that of biphasic waveforms with the same tilts for anodal but not cathodal phase 1 at the right ventricular electrode. Electrode polarity significantly affected the DFT of triphasic waveforms for both studies.\par
  {\em Conclusions} -- Some 80% tilt triphasic waveforms defibrillate more efficiently than biphasic waveforms with a 300-µF-capacitor defibrillator. The triphasic waveforms for both groups were not superior to 140-µF-capacitor biphasic waveforms. The efficacy of triphasic waveforms depends on phase durations and electrode polarity.},

Furthermore, cell excitability and its variability underlie many electrophysiological phenomena in the heart. In this study, we used a detailed mathematical model of the ventricular myocyte to investigate the determinants of excitability and gain insight into the mechanism by which excitability depends on the rate and duration of pacing (the memory effect). Results: i) The primary determinant of excitability depends upon the duration (T) of the stimulus. ii) For a short T, excitability is determined by the difference between the threshold membrane potential and the resting membrane potential. iii) For a long T, excitability is determined by the resting membrane resistance, $R_m$. iv) In the case of long T, pacing induced changes in [\ionNa]$_i$ and [\ionCa]$_i$ over time affect $R_m$ and excitability by shifting the current-voltage (IV) curve in the vertical direction and are responsible for the memory effect. Conclusions: The results have important implications during an arrhythmia, where a cardiac cell may be subjected to rapid repetitive excitation for an extended period of time. Effective anti-arrhythmic strategies may be developed to exploit the $R_m$ dependence of excitability for a long T.},

The aims of this study are to compare model behavior during prolonged periods of pacing using the algebraic and differential methods, and to address the issue of model drift. We pace the Luo-Rudy dynamic model of a cardiac ventricular cell and compare the time-dependent behavior of computed parameters using the algebraic and differential methods. When ions carried by the stimulus current are taken into account, the algebraic and differential methods yield identical results and neither shows drift in computed parameters. The present study establishes the proper pacing protocol for simulation studies of cellular behavior during long periods of rapid pacing.

Here, the authors present an automated approach which combines detailed, three-dimensional (3-D) finite-element torso models with optimization techniques to provide a flexible analysis and design tool for electrical defibrillation optimization. Specifically, a parallel direct search (PDS) optimization technique is used with a representative objective function to find an electrode configuration which corresponds to the satisfaction of a postulated defibrillation criterion with a minimum amount of power and a low possibility of myocardium damage. For adequate representation of the thoracic inhomogeneities, 3-D finite-element torso models are used in the objective function computations. The CPU-intensive finite-element calculations required for the objective function evaluation have been implemented on a message-passing parallel computer in order to complete the optimization calculations in a timely manner. To illustrate the optimization procedure, it has been applied to a representative electrode configuration for transmyocardial defibrillation, namely the subcutaneous patch-right ventricular catheter (SP-RVC) system. Sensitivity of the optimal solutions to various tissue conductivities has been studied. Results for the optimization of defibrillation systems are presented which demonstrate the feasibility of the approach.},

Final case considered had an inner-sphere distribution resulting from two tangential dipoles with the same geometry as before and the outer sphere distribution was perturbed by 1\% noise.  It is shown that if the over-regularized and under-regularized Tikhonov solutions are chosen properly, the two methods yield epicardial distributions that are more accurate and provide more qualitative information than the optimal Tikhonov solution.},

  abstract  = {A phase variable that uniquely represents the time course of the action potential has been used to study the mechanisms of cardiac fibrillation. A spatial phase singularity (PS) occurs during reentrant wave propagation and represents the organizing center of the rotating wave. Here, we present an error analysis to investigate how well PSs can be localized. Computer simulations of rotating spiral waves scaled appropriately for cardiac tissue were studied with various levels of noise added. The accuracy in identifying and localizing singularities depended on three factors: (i) the point chosen as the origin in state space used to calculate the phase variable; (ii) signal to noise ratio; and (iii) discretization (number of levels used to represent data). We found that for both simulation as well as experimental data, there existed a wide range for the choice of origin for which PSs could be identified. Discretization coupled with noise affected this range adversely. However, there always existed a range for choice of the origin that was 20% or more of the action potential amplitude within which the accuracy of localizing PSs was better than 2 mm. Thus, a precise determination of origin was not necessary for accurately identifying PSs.},

We add membrane currents from the Luo-Rudy Phase II ventricular cell model to our description of \ionCa handling to formulate a new model for ventricular action potentials and \ionCa regulation. The model can simulate \ionCa transients during an action potential similar to those seen experimentally. The subspace [\ionCa] rises more rapidly and reaches a higher level (10-30 µM) than the bulk myoplasmic \ionCa (peak $[\ionCa]_i \approx 1$ µM). Termination of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) \ionCa release is predominately due to emptying of the SR, but is influenced by RyR adaptation. Because force generation is roughly proportional to peak myoplasmic \ionCa, we use [\ionCa]$_i$ in the model to explore the effects of pacing rate on force generation. The model reproduces transitions seen in force generation due to changes in pacing that cannot be simulated by previous models. Simulation of such complex phenomena requires an interplay of both RyR adaptation and the degree of SR \ionCa loading. This model, therefore, shows improved behavior over existing models that lack detailed descriptions of subcellular \ionCa regulatory mechanisms.},

Since the permittivity distribution inside the body also contributes significantly to the measured voltages, the present reconstruction algorithm images complex conductivity distributions.  A finite element model (FEM) is used to solve the forward problem, using a 6017-node mesh for a piecewise-linear potential distribution.  The finite element solution using this mesh is compared with the analytical solution for a homogeneous field and a maximum error of 0.05\% is observed in the voltage distribution.  The boundary element method (BEM) is also used to generate the voltage data for inhomogeneous conductivity distributions inside regions with noncircular boundaries.  An iterative reconstruction algorithm is described for approximating both the conductivity and permittivity distributions from this data.  The results for an off-centered inhomogeneity showed a 35\% improvement in contrast from that seen with only one iteration, for both the conductivity and the permittivity values.  It is also shown that a significant improvement in images results from accurately modeling a noncircular boundary.  Both static and difference images are distorted by assuming a circular boundary and the amount of distortion increases significantly as the boundary shape becomes more elliptical.  For a homogeneous field in an elliptical body with axis ratio of 0.73, an image reconstructed assuming the boundary to be circular has an artifact at the center of the image with an error of 20\%.  This error increased to 37\% when the axis ratio was 0.64.  A reconstruction algorithm which used a mesh with the same axis ratio as the elliptical boundary reduced the error in the conductivity values to within 0.5\% of the actual values.},

  abstract  = {Ventricular fibrillation (VF) is the major immediate cause of sudden cardiac death. Traditionally, VF has been defined as turbulent cardiac electrical activity, which implies a large amount of irregularity in the electrical waves that underlie ventricular excitation. During VF, the heart rate is too high (> 550 excitations/minute) to allow adequate pumping of blood. In the electrocardiogram (ECG), ventricular complexes that are ever-changing in frequency, contour, and amplitude characterize VF. This article reviews prevailing theories for the initiation and maintenance of VF, as well as its spatio-temporal organization. Particular attention is given to recent experiments and computer simulations suggesting that VF may be explained in terms of highly periodic three-dimensional rotors that activate the ventricles at exceedingly high frequency. Such rotors may show at least two different behaviors: (a) At one extreme, they may drift throughout the heart at high speeds producing beat-to-beat changes in the activation sequence. (b) At the other extreme, rotors may be relatively stationary, activating the ventricles at such high frequencies that the wave fronts emanating from them breakup at varying distances, resulting in complex spatio-temporal patterns of fibrillatory conduction. In either case, the recorded ECG patterns are indistinguishable from VF. The data discussed have paved the way for a better understanding of the mechanisms of VF in the normal, as well as the diseased, human heart.\par

Here we validate a noncontact mapping approach that combines a spiral catheter design with mathematical reconstruction to generate potential maps, electrograms, and activation maps (isochrones) on the entire left ventricular endocardial surface during a single beat. The approach is applicable to any heart chamber.\par
  {\em Methods and Results:} The catheter is 3 mm (9 French) in diameter and carries 96 electrodes. Reconstruction accuracy is evaluated through direct comparison with endocardial data measured with 95 needle electrodes. Results show that endocardial potentials, electrograms, and isochrones are reconstructed with good accuracy during pacing from single or multiple sites (simulating ectopic activity). Pacing sites can be located to within 5 mm of their actual position, and intersite distances of 17 mm can be resolved during dual pacing. The reconstructed potential pattern reflects the intramural depth of pacing. The reconstructions are robust in the presence of geometric errors, and the accuracy is minimally reduced when only 62 catheter electrodes are used (32 are sufficient for pacing site localization).\par
  {\em Conclusion:} The study demonstrates that simultaneous endocardial mapping can be accomplished during a single beat from a spiral-shaped noncontact catheter with good accuracy.},

  abstract  = {Computing the potentials on the heart's epicardial surface from the body surface potentials constitutes one form of the inverse problem of electrocardiography.  An often-used approach to overcoming the ill-posed nature of the inverse problem and stabilizing the solution is via zero-order Tikhonov regularization, where the squared norms of both the surface potential residual and the solution are minimized, with a relative weight determined by a so-called regularization parameter.  This paper looks at the composite residual and smoothing operator (CRESO) and L-curve methods currently used to determine a suitable value for this regularization parameter, $t$, and proposes a third method that works just as well and is much simpler to compute.  This new zero-crossing method selects $t$ such that the squared norm of the surface potential residual is equal to $t$ times the squared norm of the solution.  Its performance was compared with those of the other two methods, using three simulation protocols of increasing complexity.  The first of these protocols involved a concentric spheres model for the heart and torso and three current dipoles placed inside the inner sphere as the source distribution.  The second replaced the spheres with realistic epicardial and torso geometries, while keeping the three-dipole source configuration.  The final simulation kept the realistic epicardial and torso geometries, but used epicardial potential distributions corresponding to both normal and ectopic activation of the heart as the source model.  Inverse solutions were computed in the presence of both geometry noise, involving assumed erroneous shifts in the heart position, and of Gaussian measurement noise added to the torso surface potentials.  It was verified that in an idealistic situation, in which correlated geometry noise dominated the uncorrelated Gaussian measurement noise, only the CRESO approach arrived at a value for $t$.  Both L-curve and zero-crossing approaches did not work.  Once measurement noise dominated geometry noise, all three approaches resulted in comparable $t$ values.  It was also shown, however, that often under low measurement noise conditions none of the three resulted in an optimum solution.},
  comment   = {Three simulation protocols of increasing complexity were used for the simulations. First simulation utilised concentric spheres with dipole source with an erroneous transfer matrix computed with the inner sphere offset 0.5~cm from centre and an additional 2\% Gaussian noise was added.  Second simulation utilised realistic epicardial and torso geometries with dipole source.  Third simulation utilised the geometry of the second protocol with an epicardial distribution computed from as activation source.  5\% Gaussian noise was added to the second and third simulations.},

It is shown that both these methods resulted in significantly better regularization parameters than that obtained with an often-used empirical Composite REsidual and Smoothing Operator approach, particularly in conditions where correlated geometry noise exceeds Gaussian measurement noise.  It is also shown that the regularization parameter that results with the minimum-product method is identical to that selected with another empirical zero-crossing approach proposed earlier.},

  abstract  = {In this paper, a simple mathematical model of a slab of cardiac tissue is presented in an attempt to better understand the relationship between subendocardial ischaemia and the resulting epicardial potential distributions. The cardiac tissue is represented by the bidomain model where tissue anisotropy and fiber rotation have been incorporated with a view to predicting the epicardial surface potential distribution. The source of electric potential in this steady-state problem is the difference between plateau potentials in normal and ischaemic tissue, where it is assumed that ischaemic tissue has a lower plateau potential. Simulations with tissue anisotropy and no fiber rotation are also considered.\par
  Simulations are performed for various thicknesses of the transition region between normal and ischaemic tissue and for various sizes of the ischaemic region. The simulated epicardial potential distributions, based on an anisotropic model of the cardiac tissue, show that there are large potential gradients above the border of the ischaemic region and that there are dips in the potential distri-bution above the region of ischaemia. It could be concluded from the simulations that it would be possible to predict the region of subendocardial ischaemia from the epicardial potential distribution, a conclusion contrary to observed experimental data. Possible reasons for this discrepancy are discussed.\par
  In the interests of mathematical simplicity, isotropic models of the cardiac tissue are also considered, but results from these simulations predict epicardial potential distributions vastly different from experimental observations. A major conclusion from this work is that tissue anisotropy and fiber rotation must be included to obtain meaningful and realistic epicardial potential distributions.},

The dog heart, paced for several weeks at a fast rate to induce heart failure is prone to arrhythmia. The aim of this study was to determine the activation patterns of spontaneous and electrically induced arrhythmia and the susceptibility of the failing dog heart to arrhythmia and early afterdepolarization (EAD) induced triggered activity elicited by exogenous administration of cesium chloride (CsCl). The hearts of 56 mongrel dogs were paced at 240 beats/min for 3-5 weeks (heart failure group). Twenty-one similarly operated, but not paced dogs served as the control group. At baseline, all dogs were healthy as assessed electrophysiologically and hemodynamically. Spontaneous (bradycardia, tachycardia, and arrhythmic deaths) and electrically induced arrhythmia was frequent in dogs with heart failure. Also, the minimal dose of CsCl that produced ventricular tachycardia was significantly lower in the heart failure than the control dogs (1.02 +/- 0.02 vs 1.21 +/- 0.07 mMol/kg, P < 0.05). Epicardial mapping during spontaneous and electrically induced arrhythmia in the heart failure dogs showed initiation patterns with focal origin, often from multiple sites. This pattern was consistent with the patterns observed with CsCl induced ventricular tachycardia. In in vitro microelectrode studies, CsCl superfusion (2.5-5 mMol/L) induced triggered activity due to EADs within 30 minutes, in seven of the eight Purkinje fibers from four heart failure dogs. EADs were also found in ventricular myocytes of papillary muscle from two heart failure dogs. In contrast, 5 mMol/L CsCl induced EADs in only one of eight Purkinje fibers from the hearts of four control dogs and no papillary myocytes even with continuous superfusion for up to 60 minutes (P < 0.01). These results demonstrate that pacing induced heart failure in the dog has an increased tendency to develop ventricular tachycardia and triggered activity unmasked by CsCl.},

The method utilizes the patient's own X-ray CT scan and a simplified meshing scheme to quickly and efficiently generate a model typically composed of approximately 400,000 elements.  A parameter sensitivity study on one human thorax model to examine the effects of variation in assigned tissue resistivity values, level of anatomical detail included in the model, and number of CT slices used to produce the model is presented.  Of the seven tissue types examined, the average left ventricular (LV) myocardial voltage gradient was most sensitive to the values of myocardial and blood resistivity.  Incorrectly simplifying the model, for example modeling the heart as a homogeneous structure by ignoring the blood in the chambers, caused the average LV myocardial voltage gradient to increase by 12\%.  The sensitivity of the model to variations in electrode size and position was also examined.  Small changes (<2.0 cm) in electrode position caused average LV myocardial voltage gradient values to increase by up to 12\%.  It is concluded that patient-specific 3D finite element modeling of human thoracic electric fields is feasible and may reduce the empiric approach to insertion of implantable defibrillators and improve transthoracic defibrillation techniques.},

The measured voltage values were compared to the model predictions resulting in a correlation coefficient of 0.927+/-0.036 (average+/-standard deviation) and a relative rms error of 22.13+/-5.99\%.  The model predictions of voltage gradient within the myocardium were also examined revealing differences in the percent of the myocardium above a threshold value for various electrode configurations and variability between individual animals.  This variability reinforces the potential benefit of patient-specific modeling.},

We also simulated the effects of a periodic spatial variation in $R_i$, representing a structure with groups of well-coupled cells but with minimal coupling between the groups. Even with a constant membrane model and cell size, variations in the spatial pattern of interconnection produced significant changes in action potential shape and velocity, with some patterns producing decremental conduction or propagation failure.},

We have used simulation techniques to predict the spatial distribution of action potential parameters resulting from discretely localized alterations in the intrinsic membrane properties of some of the cells of an electrical syncytium. We have shown that the resulting spatial distribution is markedly different for alterations in plateau and pacemaker currents vs. rising phase currents, and that other factors, such as the site of stimulation and the underlying spatial pattern of cell-cell coupling resistance, also modify the spatial distribution of action potential properties resulting from a discrete regional change in intrinsic membrane properties.},

Understanding normal and abnormal atrial activity requires an understanding of this process. We studied interactions of a cell with spontaneous activity, represented by a ``real-time'' simulation of a model of the rabbit sinoatrial (SA) node cell, simultaneously being electrically coupled via our ``coupling clamp'' circuit to a real, isolated atrial myocyte with variations in coupling conductance ($G_c$) or stimulus frequency. The atrial cells were able to be driven at a regular rate by a single SA node model (SAN model) cell. Critical $G_c$ for entrainment of the SAN model cell to a nonstimulated atrial cell was 0.55 ± 0.05 nS (n = 7), and the critical $G_c$ that allowed entrainment when the atrial cell was directly paced at a basic cycle length of 300 ms was 0.32 ± 0.01 nS (n = 7). For each atrial cell we found periodic phenomena of synchronization other than 1:1 entrainment when $G_c$ was between 0.1 and 0.3 nS, below the value required for frequency entrainment, when the atrial cell was directly driven at a basic cycle length of either 300 or 600 ms. In conclusion, the high input resistance of the atrial cells allows successful entrainment of nodal and atrial cells at low values of $G_c$, but further uncoupling produces arrhythmic interactions.},

We investigated the critical size of an automatic focus for the activation of two-dimensional arrays made up of either ventricular or atrial model cells. Over a range of coupling conductances for the arrays, the critical size of the focus cell group for successful propagation was smaller for activation of an atrial versus a ventricular array. Failure of activation of the arrays at smaller focus sizes was due to the inhibition of pacing of the nodal cells. At low levels of coupling conductance, the ventricular arrays required larger sizes of the focus due to failure of propagation even when the focus was spontaneously active. The major differences between activation of the atrial and ventricular arrays is due to the higher membrane resistance (lower inward rectifier current) of the atrial cells.},

The electrical conductive properties of eight distinct tissues were incorporated, including the anisotropic properties of skeletal muscle. Current density distributions were obtained for six paddle pairings and two paddle sizes. A quantitative basis for comparing the resulting distributions was formulated. The results suggest that placing one or both of the paddles near the heart delivers a higher fraction of current to the heart. However, such placements also produce a less uniform myocardial current density distribution and thus have a higher potential for causing damage. Some paddle positions produced myocardial current densities close to the threshold for damage in successful defibrillations. The results indicate that 12 cm paddles may offer modest advantages over 8 cm paddles in clinical defibrillation.},

However, anisotropy variations caused defibrillation parameters such as paddle to paddle impedance and threshold current to change by as much as 50\%.  The authors found a greater sensitivity in the myocardial current density and the defibrillation parameters to variations in model inhomogeneity.  The changes observed in both depended substantially on paddle placement.  This sensitivity to paddle placement highlights the difficulty in predicting how a reduction in anatomical detail will affect the myocardial current density distribution.

The package includes components for model construction, simulation, visualisation and detailed analysis of simulation output based on volume conductor theory. Due to the methods developed, models can comprise more anatomical details than the prior computer models. Several models have been constructed, for example, a highly detailed 3-D anatomically accurate computer model of the human thorax as a volume conductor utilising the US National Library of Medicine's (NLM) Visible Human Man (VHM) digital anatomy data.

We give rigorous verification that there is a vulnerable phase, and demonstrate numerically that permanently rotating waves are formed. Finally, it is shown that the direction of fastest propagation in myocardium is not necessarily the direction of highest safety factor, contrary to commonly accepted opinion.},

  abstract  = {{\em Background} Mapping of endocardial activation is an important procedure for diagnosing cardiac arrhythmias and locating the arrhythmogenic site before treatment. The objective of the present study was to develop and test a mathematical method to reconstruct the endocardial potentials and activation sequences (isochrones) from potential data measured with a noncontact, intracavitary multielectrode probe (the ``inverse problem'').\par
  {\em Methods and Results} A boundary element based mathematical method, combined with a numeric regularization technique, was developed for computing the inverse solution. Endocardial potentials were computed from intracavitary potentials measured with a multielectrode probe placed in the cavity of an isolated, perfused canine left ventricle. Data were acquired during rhythms induced by electrical stimuli applied at different locations and varying depths within the myocardium. Endocardial potentials were measured using intramural needles to evaluate the accuracy of the inverse solutions by direct comparison. Inversely computed endocardial potentials, from measured probe potentials, reconstruct with good accuracy the major features (potential maxima and minima, regions of negative and positive potentials) compared with the measured endocardial potentials. During early activation, the computed endocardial potentials exhibit a potential minimum in close proximity to the pacing site, determining the location of the stimulus with good accuracy (within 10-mm error). Multiple stimuli, as close as 10 to 20 mm to each other, can be distinguished and localized to their sites of origin by the inverse reconstruction. Similar to the measured endocardial potentials, the spatial distribution of the computed endocardial potentials reflects the underlying cardiac fiber direction, and dynamic changes of the computed endocardial potentials reflect the rotation of fibers with intramural depth. Maps of isochrones show good correspondence between the isochrones determined from the computed endocardial potentials and those determined directly from the measured endocardial potentials.\par
  {\em Conclusions} Compared with actual, measured endocardial potentials and activation sequences, endocardial potential patterns and activation sequences can be reconstructed on a beat-by-beat basis from cavitary potentials measured with a multielectrode, noncontact probe. The approach presented here is shown to reconstruct, with 10-mm accuracy and resolution of 10 to 20 mm, local events of cardiac excitation (eg, pacing sites). In addition, the reconstructed endocardial potentials correctly reflect the underlying fibrous structure of the myocardium. These results demonstrate the feasibility of the approach. In the experiments, the probe position and endocardial geometry were determined invasively. To be clinically applicable, the reconstruction method should be combined with a noninvasive method for determining the probe-cavity geometry in the catheterization laboratory. It could then be developed into a catheter-based technique for locating arrhythmogenic sites and for studying and diagnosing conduction abnormalities, reentrant activity, and the effects of drugs and other interventions on cardiac activation and arrhythmias.},

  abstract  = {{\em Background} -- The feasibility of measuring cavitary electrograms using a noncontact probe and reconstructing endocardial surface electrograms and activation sequences during paced beats was previously demonstrated in the isolated canine left ventricle (LV). The objective of the present study was to develop and test a high-resolution, three-dimensional, endocardial electrophysiological imaging technique that simultaneously reconstructs endocardial surface electrograms and their corresponding activation sequences during normal and abnormal beats with the use of cavitary electrograms measured with a noncontact multielectrode probe in the intact canine LV.\par
  {\em Methods and Results} -- A 128-electrode probe was inserted into the intact canine LV. Probe unipolar electrograms were simultaneously acquired during sinus, artificially paced, and spontaneous premature beats. Representative endocardial electrograms were measured directly using eight needle electrodes (the ``gold standard''). A probe-cavity realistic, three-dimensional geometric model was constructed using two-dimensional epicardial echocardiography. Boundary element methods and numeric regularization were used to compute electrograms at 194 sites on the endocardium. In eight pacing protocols, computed endocardial electrograms correlated well with directly measured electrograms (r=.88). Corresponding activation times were also in agreement with those determined from measured endocardial electrograms (activation error, 4.7 ms). The earliest region of activation was invariably in the vicinity of the pacing needle (spatial error, 9.2 mm). Subsequently, the site of origin of ischemia-induced spontaneous ventricular premature beats and the ensuing sequence of depolarization was identified.\par
  {\em Conclusions} -- Noncontact mapping provides realistic, three-dimensional electrophysiological images of the endocardium, on a beat-by-beat basis, that localize the sites of origin of premature beats and reconstruct their activation sequences.},

The QRS and ST-segment were analyzed and compared to the arterial patency as assessed by arteriography within 10 days. The infarct-related vessel was patent in 50 patients and occluded in the remaining 16. In 6 of the 15 patients in whom thrombolytic therapy was started within 2 hours of the onset of chest pain the ST-segment changed from that of an acute infarction pattern to that of a normal pattern, and the QRS pattern either remained normal or recovered prior to discharge. In two additional patients the QRS pattern returned to normal prior to discharge from the hospital. In the 51 patients with later thrombolytic therapy (>= 2 hours) the degree of ST elevation and depression decreased more than either the control infarction group (36 inferior and 73 anterior patients) or the group in whom reperfusion attempts were unsuccessful, but the pattern of the map remained that of an infarction. The QRS maps showed that in the first 48 hours recovery of potential was insufficient to distinguish those with successful thrombolysis. Early reperfusion could be detected by body surface potential mapping and the eventual damage predicted from the degree of change in the QRS map. Later reperfusion could be surmised but not quantified.},

The model construction was based on the Utah Torso model and included geometry for major anatomical structures such as subcutaneous fat, skeletal muscle, and lungs, as well as for epicardial fatpads, major arteries and veins, and the sternum, ribs, spine, and clavicles.  Measured epicardial potentials served as the electrical source for solutions to the electrocardiographic forward problem computed using the finite element method (FEM).  The geometry of the torso model for each simulation was constant, but different combinations of conductivities were assigned to individual organs or tissues.  Comparisons of different conductivity combinations followed one of two basic schemes: 1) a homogeneous torso served as the reference against which we compared simulations with a single organ or tissue and assigned its nominal conductivity, or 2) a fully inhomogeneous torso served as the reference and we removed the effect of individual organs or tissues by assigning it the homogeneous conductivity value.  When single inhomogeneities were added to an otherwise homogeneous isotropic model, anisotropic skeletal muscle (at a 15:1 anisotropy ratio) and the right and left lung had larger average effects (12.8, 12.7, and 12.1\% relative error (RE), respectively) than the other inhomogeneities tested.  Our results for removing single inhomogeneities show that the subcutaneous fat, the anisotropic skeletal muscle (with the degree of anisotropy equal to 7:1), and the lungs have larger average impacts on the body surface potential distributions than other elements of the model (with values of 14.9, 12.6, and 11.7\% RE, respectively).  The results also show that the size of the effect depended strongly on the distribution of epicardial potentials.  The results of this study suggest that accurate representation of tissue inhomogeneity has a significant effect on the accuracy of the forward solution, with regions near the torso surface playing a larger role, in general, than those near the heart.},

The epicardium received shocks from symmetrical or asymmetrical electrodes to produce nominally uniform or nonuniform VGs. Extracellular electric field and $\Delta V_m$ produced by shocks in the absolute refractory period were measured with electrodes and a laser scanner and were simulated with a bidomain computer model that incorporated the anterior left ventricular epicardial fiber field. Measurements and simulations showed that fibers distorted extracellular voltages and influenced the $\Delta V_m$. For both uniform and nonuniform shocks, $\Delta V_m$ depended primarily on second spatial derivatives of extracellular voltages, whereas the VGs played a smaller role. Thus, 1) fiber structure influences the extracellular electric field and the distribution of $\Delta V_m$; 2) the $\Delta V_m$ depend on second spatial derivatives of extracellular voltage.},

Already, electrophysiologically detailed cardiac cell models have been incorporated into mathematical descriptions of representative ventricular tissue architecture and anatomy, including the coronary vasculature, and assimilated to realistic representation of ventricular active and passive mechanical properties. This is being extended by matching atrial models and linked to an artificial torso to compute the body surface electrocardiogram as a function of sub-cellular activity during various (patho-)physiological conditions.\par

We used a novel magnetocardiographic technique to investigate the role of inhomogeneous repolarization in patients with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy prone to sustained ventricular arrhythmias.\par
  {\em Methods and Results:} Forty-nine dilated cardiomyopathy patients were studied, 18 with a history of sustained ventricular tachycardia (n = 6) or ventricular fibrillation (n = 12) and 31 with no ventricular arrhythmias. The magnetocardiogram was registered and QT apex and QT end intervals were determined by a computer algorithm. Inhomogeneity of repolarization was characterized with indices describing QT apex and QT end dispersion, and T wave end duration. In addition, time-domain late fields of the QRS complex in magnetocardiography and QT dispersion in 12-lead ECG were determined. T wave end was longer in the arrhythmia group in patients with sinus rhythm (87 ± 15 msec vs 73 ± 12 msec; P = 0.005) and in those not having bundle branch block. Magnetocardiographic late fields of the QRS complex were not different between groups. QT apex and end dispersion on magnetocardiography or 12-lead ECG showed no difference.\par
  {\em Conclusion:} Prolongation of the end part of the T wave revealed by magnetocardiography is related to malignant ventricular arrhythmias in dilated cardiomyopathy. The results suggest that abnormal repolarization rather than delayed conduction underlies the arrhythmias in this disease.},

Twenty-one patients underwent PTCA for left anterior descending coronary disease, 13 for right coronary artery disease, and 10 for left circumflex; 1 patient had combined left anterior descending and right coronary artery disease. In each patient, voltage data recorded during the various phases of the procedure were compared with the patient's own baseline data. In 18 patients, 120 leads were also recorded 24 hours after PTCA. In this study, the usefulness of the standard 12-lead ECG was investigated in locating the coronary artery being occluded, in elucidating the mechanisms of the QRS changes, and in identifying changes occurring 24 hours after completion of the procedure. Results indicate that the observation of ST elevation in the 12-lead ECG may lead to ambiguous interpretation. Also, limiting observation to ST-T patterns alone instead of including QRS changes further hampers correct identification of the involved vessel. QRS modifications during inflation are interpreted as conduction disturbances, although other mechanisms are evoked: study of surface maps may contribute to the understanding of these mechanisms. Changes present 24 hours later are visible in the standard leads, but again, in the absence of the thoracic potential distribution, these are difficult to interpret. These changes were different from those observed after cessation of inflation at the end of the procedure. It is hypothesized that next-day changes may reflect reperfusion injury and/or represent myocardial stunning. Presence of injury and reversibility of changes require further investigation. Also, biochemical markers such as creatine kinase-MB mass, creatine kinase-MB activity, myoglobin, and troponin-T may help elucidate the significance of these findings.},

The branches slow conduction by acting as current loads drawing depolarizing current from the main strand (``pull'' effect). It has been suggested that, upon depolarization of the branches, they become current sources reinjecting current back into the strand, thus enhancing propagation safety (``push'' effect). It was the aim of this study to verify this hypothesis and to assess the contribution of the push effect to propagation velocity and safety. Conduction was investigated in strands of Luo-Rudy dynamic model cells that branch from either a single branch point or from multiple successive branch points. In single-branching strands, blocking the push effect by not allowing current to flow retrogradely from the branches into the strand did not significantly increase the branching-induced local propagation delay. However, in multiple branching strands, blocking the push effect resulted in a significant slowing of overall conduction velocity or even in conduction failure. Furthermore, for certain slow velocities, the safety factor for propagation was higher when slow conduction was caused by branching tissue geometry than by reduced excitability without branching. Therefore, these results confirm the proposed ``pull and push'' mechanism of slow, but nevertheless robust, conduction in branching structures. Slow conduction based on this mechanism could occur in the atrioventricular node, where multiple branching is structurally present. It could also support reentrant excitation in diseased myocardium where the substrate is structurally complex.},

  abstract  = {Multielectrode catheters provide a percutaneous means of recording activation near the epicardium but only for a relatively small number of sites that are restricted to the major coronary vessels. We have applied a statistical signal processing technique to estimate the value of activation time over the entire epicardium (490 sites) from leadsets consisting of 4 to 40 sites aligned with major branches of the coronary veins. We tested this method using data from high-resolution epicardial mapping from six dog hearts and 153 activation sequences. A study including data from both normal and infarcted dog hearts yielded estimates of activation time, with mean correlation coefficients ranging from 0.97 to 0.84 and achieved localization of earliest site of activation to within 3 to 15 mm, depending on training parameters and leadset. These results suggest that with 10 to 15 catheter-mounted electrodes, it may be possible to reconstruct epicardial activation maps from percutaneous recordings.},

This paper explores a new hypothesis: the insulated plunge electrodes used in experiments to map the extracellular potential may affect the transmembrane potential when an electric field is applied to cardiac tissue. Our calculation simulates a 10-mm-diameter sheet of passive tissue with a circular insulated plunge electrode in the middle of it, ranging in diameter from 0.05 to 2 mm. We calculate the transmembrane potential induced by a 500-V/m electric field. Our results show that a transmembrane potential is induced around the electrode in alternating areas of depolarization and hyperpolarization. If the electric field is oriented parallel to the myocardial fibers, the maximum transmembrane potential is 89 mV. A layer of fluid around the electrode increases the transmembrane potential. We conclude that plunge electrodes may introduce artifacts during experiments designed to study the response of the heart to strong electric shocks.},

Through the bidomain model, the syncytial and anisotropic properties of cardiac tissue are taken into account; tissues with equal anisotropy and no transverse coupling are also considered. The membrane is represented by a capacitor and passive resistor in parallel. Located within an isotropic bath, the bipolar electrode is oriented either perpendicular or parallel to the tissue surface. For anisotropic tissue with a small cathode-tissue separation, the tissue surface is highly depolarized under the cathode with the depolarization persisting a considerable distance from the electrode in the transverse fiber direction. Adjacent to this region in the longitudinal direction, areas of hyperpolarization exist. At large distances from the cathode, the tissue surface is hyperpolarized in all directions when the electrode axis is perpendicular to the tissue. In the parallel case, surface depolarization creates buried regions of hyperpolarization. For the perpendicular configuration, the ratio of the steady-state maximum depolarization to steady-state maximum hyperpolarization, an estimate of the ratio of anodal to cathodal threshold, decreases rapidly with increasing cathode-tissue separation. In the parallel case, the depth of the conductive bath significantly affected the transmembrane potential distribution in the tissue. The use of a 3-D model more realistically simulates real-life electrical stimulation (such as stimulation with an implantable pacemaker) and provides insight into the effect of the volume conductor adjacent to the tissue.},

However, it is not clear whether these surface patterns are caused by multiple distinct mechanisms or by a single mechanism. To determine the mechanism by which wave breaks are generated during ventricular fibrillation, we conducted optical mapping studies and single cell transmembrane potential recording in six isolated swine right ventricles (RV). Among 763 episodes of wave break (0.75 times · s$^{-1}$ · cm$^{-2}$), optical maps showed three patterns: 80% due to a wave front encountering the refractory wave back of another wave, 11.5% due to wave fronts passing perpendicular to each other, and 8.5% due to a new (target) wave arising just beyond the refractory tail of a previous wave. Computer simulations of scroll waves in three-dimensional tissue showed that these surface patterns could be attributed to two fundamental mechanisms: head-tail interactions and filament break. We conclude that during sustained ventricular fibrillation in swine RV, surface patterns of wave break are produced by two fundamental mechanisms: head-tail interaction between waves and filament break.},

Full-thickness segments were cut from the right and left ventricular walls at a series of precisely located sites. Morphology was visualized macroscopically and with scanning electron microscopy in 1) transmural planes of section and 2) planes tangential to the epicardial surface. The appearance of all specimens was consistent with an ordered laminar arrangement of myocytes with extensive cleavage planes between muscle layers. These planes ran radially from endocardium toward epicardium in transmural section and coincided with the local muscle fiber orientation in tangential section. Stereological techniques were used to quantify aspects of this organization. There was no consistent variation in the cellular organization of muscle layers (48.4 +/- 20.4 \micro m thick and 4 +/- 2 myocytes across) transmurally or in different ventricular regions (23 sites in 6 segments), but there was significant transmural variation in the coupling between adjacent layers. The number of branches between layers decreased twofold from subepicardium to midwall, whereas the length distribution of perimysial collagen fibers connecting muscle layers was greatest in the midwall. We conclude that ventricular myocardium is not a uniformly branching continuum but a laminar hierarchy in which it is possible to identify three axes of material symmetry at any point.},

  abstract  = {The passive electrical properties of cardiac tissue, such as the intracellular and interstitial conductivities along the longitudinal and transverse axes, have not been often measured because intracellular electrodes are usually needed for these measurements. In this paper, we present a theoretical analysis of two myocardial models developed to estimate these properties by analyzing potentials recorded with a pair of extracellular electrodes while injecting alternating current between another pair of electrodes. First, the cardiac tissue is represented by a standard bidomain model which includes a membrane capacitance; second, this model is modified by adding an intracellular capacitance representing the intercalated disks. Numerical solutions are computed with a fast Fourier transform algorithm without constraining the anisotropy ratios of the interstitial and intracellular domains. We systematically investigate the effects of changes in the bidomain parameters on the voltage-to-current ratio curves. We also demonstrate how the bidomain parameters can be theoretically estimated by fitting, with a modified Shor's r algorithm, the simulated potentials along the longitudinal and transverse axes for different frequencies between 10 and 10 000 Hz. An important finding is that the interelectrode distance must be similar to the myocardial space constant so as to obtain frequency dependent measurements.},

The sheet model of 2.5 x 10 mm consisted of a set of 100 parallel cables coupled through a regular array of identical transverse resistors. The membrane dynamics was represented by a modified Beeler-Reuter model. We defined the charging factor (CF) to represent by a single number the proportion of input current used to charge the membrane locally below threshold and showed that CF is inversely correlated with the time constant of the foot of the action potential ($\tau_{foot}$) during propagation on a cable. A safety factor of propagation (SF) was also defined for the upstroke of the action potential, with SF directly correlated with the maximum rate of depolarization ($V_{max}$) and, for cablelike propagation, with propagation velocity. Propagation along the principal longitudinal axis of the elliptic wave front is cablelike but, in comparison with a flat wave front, transverse current flow provides a drag effect that somewhat reduces the propagation velocity, $V_{max}$, SF, and CF. With a longitudinal-to-transverse velocity ratio of 3:1 or more, the wave front propagating along the principal transverse axis is essentially flat and is characterized by multiple collisions between successive pairs of input junctions on a given cable; $V_{max}$, SF, and CF are larger than for longitudinal propagation, but CF is no longer correlated with $\tau_{foot}$. There are transient increases in propagation velocity and $V_{max}$ with distance from the stimulation site along both principal axes until stablized values are achieved, and a similar transient decrease in $\tau_{foot}$. Away from the principal axes, the action potential characteristics change progressively along the elliptic wave front. \dots},

  abstract  = {A thin sheet of cardiac tissue was modeled as a set of resistively coupled excitable cables with membrane dynamics described by the modified Beeler Reuter model. Transverse connections have a resistance $R_n$ and are regularly distributed with a spacing \Delta on any given cable, to provide alternating input and output junctions. Flat wave longitudinal propagation corresponds to propagation along a single continuous cable since all units of the network are functionally isolated due to the absence of transverse current flow. \dots Overall, the behavior of the network model is in good agreement with available structural and electrophysiological data on myocardium. The network topology allows parameters governing propagation to be addressed more easily and avoids very large and computationally costly matrices.},

  abstract  = {Conceptually, transthoracic defibrillation threshold current can be considered a function of at least two quantities. It is directly proportional to the transcardiac threshold current and inversely proportional to the transcardiac current fraction (F_C) or the ratio of transcardiac and transthoracic current. Although experimental and theoretical estimates of F_C have been as high as 45%, previous measurements in humans have not been made. This study was designed to quantify F_C in humans. During intraoperative testing of the automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator, transthoracic rescue shocks of 200-400 J were delivered when the device failed to defibrillate. Simultaneous transthoracic voltage (V_T) and transcardiac voltage (V_C) between two implanted epicardial patch electrodes were measured. The ratio, V_C/V_T, was 0.04 +/- 0.03 (mean +/- SD) in 10 patients. In 16 dogs, a comparison was made between direct measurement of F_C and V_C/V_T. F_C was determined with a specially designed electrode system, which was calibrated to account for field distortion introduced by the electrodes. There was no significant difference between F_C and V_C/V_T, which were both approximately 0.05, suggesting that V_C/V_T was statistically equivalent to F_C. The results of this study, therefore, indicate that during transthoracic defibrillation in humans, approximately 4% of transthoracic current traverses the heart. This relatively small percentage of current results from the existence of parallel pathways, such as the thoracic cage and lungs, which shunt current around the heart.},

An artificial neural network based preliminary diagnosis system has been developed to limit the searching space of the optimization algorithm and to initialize the model parameters in the computer heart model.  The optimal heart model parameters were obtained by minimizing the objective functions, as functions of the observed and model-generated body surface ECGs.  We have tested the feasibility of the newly developed tech-nique in localizing the site of origin of cardiac activation using a pace mapping protocol.  The present computer simulation results show that, the present approach for localization of the site of origin of ventricular activation achieved an averaged localization error of about 3~mm [for 5~\micro V Gaussian white noise (GWN)] and 4~mm (for 10~\micro V GWN), with standard deviation of the localization errors of being about 1.5~mm.  The present simulation study suggests that this newly developed approach provides a robust inverse solution, circumventing the difficulties of the ECG inverse problem, and may become an important alternative to other ECG inverse solutions.},

  abstract  = {{\em Introduction:} Our previous article examined cardiac vulnerability to reentry in the near field within the framework of the virtual electrode polarization (VEP) concept. The present study extends this examination to the far field and compares its predictions to the critical point hypothesis.\par
  {\em Methods and Results:} We simulate the electrical behavior of a sheet of myocardium using a two-dimensional bidomain model. The fiber field is extrapolated from a set of rabbit heart fiber directions obtained experimentally. An S1 stimulus is applied along the top or left border. An extracellular line electrode on the top delivers a cathodal or anodal S2 stimulus. A VEP pattern matching that seen experimentally is observed and covers the entire sheet, thus constituting a far-field effect. Reentry arises from break excitation, make excitation, or a combination of both, and subsequent propagation through deexcited and recovered areas. Reentry occurs in cross-field, parallel-field, and uniform refractoriness protocols. For long coupling intervals (CIs) above $CI^{make}_{min}$ (defined as the shortest CI at which make excitation can take place), rotors move away from the cathodal electrode and the S1 site for increases in S2 strength and CI, respectively. For cathodal S2 stimuli, findings are consistent with the critical point hypothesis. For CIs below $CI^{make}_{min}$, reentry is initiated by break excitation only, and the resulting reentrant patterns are no longer consistent with those predicted by the critical point hypothesis.\par
  {\em Conclusion:} Shock-induced VEP can explain vulnerability in the far field. The VEP theory of vulnerability encompasses the critical point hypothesis for cathodal S2 shocks at long CIs.},

  abstract  = {Recent studies have described regional differences in the electrophysiology and pharmacology of ventricular myocardium in canine, feline, rat, guinea pig, and human hearts. In this study, we use standard microelectrode and whole-cell patch-clamp techniques to examine the characteristics of the action potential and the delayed rectifier \ionK current (\I{K}) in epicardial, M region (deep subepicardial to midmyocardial), and endocardial cells isolated from the canine left ventricle. Cells from the M region displayed much longer action potential durations (APDs) at slow rates. At a basic cycle length of 4 s, APD measured at 90% repolarization was 358±16 (mean±SEM), 262±12, and 287±11 ms in cells from the M region, epicardium, and endocardium, respectively. Steady state APD-rate relations were steeper in cells from the M region. In complete Tyrode's solution, \I{K} was smaller in myocytes from the M region when compared with those isolated from the epicardium or endocardium. Further characterization of \I{K} was conducted in a \ionNa-, \ionK-, and \ionCa-free bath solution to isolate the slowly activating component of the delayed rectifier (I{Ks}) from the rapidly activating component (\I{Kr}). \I{Ks} was significantly smaller in M cells than in epicardial and endocardial cells. With repolarization to -20 mV, \I{Ks} tail current density was 1.99±0.30 pA/pF (mean±SEM) in epicardial cells, 1.83±0.18 pA/pF in endocardial cells, and 0.92±0.14 pA/pF in M cells. Voltage dependence and time course of activation and deactivation of \I{Ks} were similar in the three cell types. The relative contribution of \I{Kr} and \I{Ks} among the three cell types was examined by using 6 mmol/L [\ionK]$_o$ Tyrode's solution with and without E-4031, a highly selective blocker of \I{Kr}. An E-4031-sensitive current was observed in the presence but not in the absence of extracellular \ionK. This rapidly activating component showed characteristics similar to those of \I{Kr} as described in rabbit and cat ventricular cells. Deactivation of \I{Kr} was significantly slower than that of \I{Ks}. \I{Kr} (E-4031-sensitive component) tail current density was similar in the three cell types, whereas \I{Ks} (E-4031-insensitive component) tail current density was significantly smaller in the M cells. Our results suggest that the distinctive phase-3 repolarization features of M cells are due in part to a lesser contribution of \I{Ks} and that this distinction may also explain why M cells are the main targets for agents that prolong APD in ventricular myocardium. These findings may advance our understanding of the ionic basis for the electrocardiographic T wave, U wave, and long QT intervals as well as our understanding of factors contributing to the development of cardiac arrhythmias.},

  abstract  = {{\em Introduction:} Mapping endocardial activation and repolarization processes is critical to the study of arrhythmias and selection of therapeutic procedures. Previously, we developed methodology for reconstructing endocardial potentials from potentials measured with a noncontact, intracavitary probe. This study further develops and evaluates the ability of the approach to provide detailed information on the spatiotemporal characteristics of the activation process. Specifically, we reconstructed endocardial electrograms and isochrones throughout the activation process over the entire endocardium during a single beat.\par
  {\em Methods and Results:} Cavity potentials were measured with a 65-electrode probe placed inside an isolated canine left ventricle. Endocardial potentials were measured simultaneously using 52 electrodes. Potentials were acquired during subendocardial pacing from different locations. Computed electrograms at various sites closely resemble the measured electrograms (correlation coefficient > 0.9 at 60% of the electrodes). Computed isochrones locate subendocardial pacing sites with 10-mm accuracy. Two pacing sites, 17 mm apart, were resolved. Critical regions, such as areas of isochrone crowding, were accurately reconstructed.\par
  {\em Conclusions:} Results indicate the applicability of the approach to mapping the cardiac excitation process on a beat-by-beat basis without occluding the ventricle. The ability of locating electrical events (e.g., single or multiple initiation sites) is demonstrated. Importantly, the method is shown to be capable of reconstructing electrograms over the entire endocardium and determining nonuniformities of activation spread (e.g., areas of slow conduction). These capabilities are important to clinical application in the electrophysiology laboratory and experimental studies of arrhythmias in the intact animal.},

Cavity geometry and endocardial potentials were recorded in an isolated canine left ventricle. Simulated catheter probes were introduced into the cavity. Probe potentials were computed from the measured endocardial potentials and perturbed to include measurement noise, geometrical errors, and limited electrode density. Endocardial potentials were then reconstructed from the perturbed probe potentials and compared to the actual measured potentials. Of all probes simulated, a 3.0 mm (9F) catheter that assumes a curved geometry (e.g., a J shape) inside the cavity performed best (better than a larger 7.6 mm cylinder simulating an inflatable probe). Without bending, a straight cylindrical probe of the same size (9F, 3.0 mm) did not perform well. Sixty probe electrodes were needed for accurate reconstruction. The J-probe reconstruction was very robust in the presence of noise (10%) and of geometry errors (3 mm shift, 10 degrees rotation). The results demonstrate the feasibility of accurate single-beat endocardial mapping using a 9F percutaneous multielectrode catheter that assumes a J shape in the cavity without the need for expansion (e.g., into a balloon or a ``basket''). The robustness of the procedure to noise and geometrical errors suggests its applicability in the clinical EP laboratory and the possibility of determining probe position in vivo using current imaging modalities.},

  abstract  = {Present-day computer models of the entire heart, capable of simulating the activation isochrones and subsequently the body surface potentials, focus on considerations of myocardial anisotropy. Myocardial anisotropy enters into play at two levels, first by affecting the spatial pattern of activation owing to faster propagation along cardiac fibers and second by altering the equivalent dipole sources used to calculate the surface potentials. The construction of a new and detailed model of the human heart is described, based on 132 transverse sections obtained following a computed tomography scan of a frozen human heart whose chambers were inflated with pressurized air. The entire heart anatomy was reconstructed as a three-dimensional array of approximately 250,000 points spaced 1 mm apart. Conduction in the thin-walled atria was assumed isotropic from the sinus node region to the atrioventricular node, where it was subject to a 50 ms delay. A two-tier representation of the specialized conduction system was used, with the initial segments of the left and right bundles represented by a system of cables that feeds to the second tier, which is a sheet of conduction tissue representing the distal Purkinje system. Approximately 1,120 ``Purkinje-myocardium'' junctions present at the terminations of the cables and sprinkled uniformly over the sheet, transmit the excitation to the ventricles. A stylized representation of myocardial fiber rotation was incorporated into the ventricles and the local fiber direction at each model point used to compute the velocity of propagation to its nearest neighbors. Accordingly, the activation times of the entire ventricular myocardium could be determined using the 1,120 or so Purkinje-myocardium junctions as start points. While myocardial anisotropy was considered in the ventricular propagation process, it was ignored in the computation of the equivalent dipole sources. Nevertheless, the computed electrocardiogram, vectorcardiogram, and body surface potential maps obtained with the new heart model properly positioned inside an inhomogeneous torso model were all within normal limits.},

The rationale was to test the model as to its ability to simulate these blocks by physiologically justifiable adjustments of the conduction system alone. The complete blocks were generated by simply blocking conduction totally at selected sites in the proximal conduction system, and the incomplete blocks by slowing down the conduction velocity in the proximal system. Also simulated were the left fascicular blocks and the bilateral blocks. All simulated electrocardiograms, vectorcardiograms, body surface potential maps, and epicardial isochrones for these blocks were similar to clinically observed data, with the exception of the left posterior hemiblock, which was slightly atypical. This could be because such blocks are usually accompanied by other cardiac pathologies not included in our simulations. The model also supports van Dam's observation that during left bundle branch block the passage of activation from right to left occurs via slow myocardial activation with no evidence of a local delay due to a septal barrier. Finally, the model suggests that a left bundle branch block with a normal frontal plane QRS axis may simply represent a case of an incomplete left bundle block, whereas one that exhibits a left axis QRS deviation in the frontal plane represents a more severe complete left bundle branch block.},

  abstract  = {A general framework for automatic model extraction from magnetic resonance (MR) images is described. The framework is based on a two-stage algorithm. In the first stage, a geometrical and topological multiresolution prior model is constructed. It is based on a pyramid of graphs. In the second stage, a matching algorithm is described. This algorithm is used to deform the prior pyramid in a constrained manner. The topological and the main geometrical properties of the model are preserved, and at the same time, the model adapts itself to the input data. We show that it performs a fast and robust model extraction from image data containing unstructured information and noise. The efficiency of the deformable pyramid is illustrated on a synthetic image. Several examples of the method applied to MR volumes are also represented.},

  abstract  = {A mathematical model of the membrane action potential of the mammalian ventricular cell is introduced. The model is based, whenever possible, on recent single-cell and single-channel data and incorporates the possibility of changing extracellular potassium concentration $[K]_o$. The fast sodium current, \I{Na}, is characterized by fast upstroke velocity ($\dot{V}_{max}$ = 400 V/sec) and slow recovery from inactivation. The time-independent potassium current, \I{K1}, includes a negative-slope phase and displays significant crossover phenomenon as $[K]_o$ is varied. The time-dependent potassium current, \I{K}, shows only a minimal degree of crossover. A novel potassium current that activates at plateau potentials is included in the model. The simulated action potential duplicates the experimentally observed effects of changes in $[K]_o$ on action potential duration and rest potential. Physiological simulations focus on the interaction between depolarization and repolarization (i.e., premature stimulation). Results demonstrate the importance of the slow recovery of \I{Na} in determining the response of the cell. Simulated responses to periodic stimulation include monotonic Wenckebach patterns and alternans at normal $[K]_o$, whereas at low $[K]_o$ nonmonotonic Wenckebach periodicities, aperiodic patterns, and enhanced supernormal excitability that results in unstable responses (``chaotic activity'') are observed. The results are consistent with recent experimental observations, and the model simulations relate these phenomena to the underlying ionic channel kinetics.},

  abstract  = {A mathematical model of the cardiac ventricular action potential is presented. In our previous work, the membrane \ionNa current and \ionK currents were formulated. The present article focuses on processes that regulate intracellular \ionCa and depend on its concentration. The model presented here for the mammalian ventricular action potential is based mostly on the guinea pig ventricular cell. However, it provides the framework for modeling other types of ventricular cells with appropriate modifications made to account for species differences. The following processes are formulated: \ionCa current through the L-type channel (\I{Ca}), the \ionNa-\ionCa exchanger, \ionCa release and uptake by the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), buffering of \ionCa in the SR and in the myoplasm, a \ionCa pump in the sarcolemma, the \ionNa-ionK pump, and a nonspecific \ionCa-activated membrane current. Activation of \I{Ca} is an order of magnitude faster than in previous models. Inactivation of \I{Ca} depends on both the membrane voltage and $[\ionCa+]_i$. SR is divided into two subcompartments, a network SR (NSR) and a junctional SR (JSR). Functionally, \ionCa enters the NSR and translocates to the JSR following a monoexponential function. Release of \ionCa occurs at JSR and can be triggered by two different mechanisms, \ionCa-induced \ionCa release and spontaneous release. The model provides the basis for the study of arrhythmogenic activity of the single myocyte including afterdepolarizations and triggered activity. It can simulate cellular responses under different degrees of \ionCa overload. Such simulations are presented in our accompanying article in this issue of {\em Circulation Research}.},

  abstract  = {The action potential model presented in our accompanying article in this journal is used to investigate phenomena that involve dynamic changes of $[\ionCa]_i$, as described below. Delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs) are induced by spontaneous \ionCa release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), which, in turn, activates both the \ionNa-\ionCa exchanger (\I{NaCa}) and a nonspecific \ionCa-activated current (\I{ns(Ca)}). The relative contributions of \I{NaCa} and of \I{ns(Ca)} to the generation of DADs are different under different degrees of \ionCa overload. Early afterdepolarizations (EADs) can be categorized into two types: (1) plateau EADs, resulting from a secondary activation of the L-type \ionCa current during the plateau of an action potential, and (2) phase-3 EADs, resulting from activation of \I{NaCa} and \I{ns(Ca)} by increased $[\ionCa]_i$ due to spontaneous \ionCa release from the SR during the late repolarization phase. Spontaneous rhythmic activity and triggered activity are caused by spontaneous \ionCa release from the SR under conditions of \ionCa overload. Postextrasystolic potentiation reflects the time delay associated with translocation of \ionCa from network SR to junctional SR. The cell is paced at high frequencies to investigate the long-term effects on the intracellular ionic concentrations.},

  abstract  = {Measurement of dynamics and spatial characteristics of ventricular repolarization is of interest in assessing patients with ischemic heart disease, particularly in relation to the detection and characterization of ischemic events, identification of patients at risk of ventricular arrhythmias, or determination of the efficacy of drugs intended to alter repolarization. The QT interval (QTI) has been the index of choice for assessing repolarization abnormalities. It is a general measure of repolarization duration but lacks the power to assess the spatial aspects of repolarization and the ability to detect localized shortening in the setting of global prolongation. For direct cardiac surface measurement, QRST integrals and activation recovery intervals (ARIs) were used to assess repolarization and its disparity. The use of similar measurements from the body surface was proposed to provide better characterization of repolarization, its disparity, and its dynamics than is possible using the QTI. In one open-chest experiment using an intact canine heart and two experiments using isolated canine hearts suspended in a torso-shaped electrolytic tank, 64 epicardial electrograms and 192 torso surface electrocardiograms were measured simultaneously. Ventricular repolarization was globally altered by varying pacing cycle lengths or tank temperature. Atrial and ventricular pacing were used to assess sensitivity of repolarization indices to activation sequence. At the cardiac surface, (1) QTI tracks global repolarization changes but is affected by activation sequence and insensitive to localized shortening of repolarization; (2) distribution of QRST integrals reflects disparity of repolarization and is largely independent of activation sequence; and (3) ARI measures local repolarization duration and is only weakly affected by activation sequence. At the body surface, findings suggest that QRST integrals reflect repolarization disparity and are largely unaffected by activation sequence, and ARIs measured at proximal locations are unlikely to correlate with direct cardiac measures of repolarization. Thus, body surface QRST and ARIs appear to provide a potentially important means of assessing repolarization, its disparity, and its dynamics, even in the presence of conduction defects.},

This article reviews the sources of variability and uncertainty in ECG measurement and interpretation, revisits some old ideas for dealing with them, and proposes some novel directions for improving accuracy of ECG assessment and interpretation. We shall explore relative information content of lead systems, representation of ECG signals and patterns, and estimation of ECG distributions from limited lead systems. In addition, we will compare strategies for measuring ECG information and suggest new paradigms for feature extraction that reduce the sensitivity of assessment accuracy to intrinsic and extrinsic measurement errors. Finally, we review the importance of including dynamic information in ECG assessment, both for interpreting current cardiac state as well as for monitoring its change and significance.},

Insulation was removed at the tips of the knots. Potential distributions and waveforms were recorded from saline solutions and rat heart epicardium during ventricular paced beats and during passive current injection in the diastolic interval. Electrical responses obtained from rat epicardium compared favorably with those observed in studies of larger-animal hearts, which used arrays having greater electrode spacing, and revealed the effects of myocardial anisotropy. Epicardial potentials measured early after stimulation in the region surrounding the pacing site were interpreted in terms of potentials generated by an equivalent quadrupolar source. We conclude that electrode arrays for epicardial mapping of small hearts can be constructed with sufficient ease and precision to allow detailed study of fiber structure and electrophysiology in these hearts in normal and pathological conditions.},

  abstract  = {In patients without significant collaterals, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) produces acute transient ischemia that is detectable in both standard electrocardiograms (ECG) and body surface potential maps (BSPMs). Control recordings made before or between inflations provide personalized baselines, which isolate the effects of ischemia from interpatient differences, such as torso shape and electrode location. In this study, two methods of evaluating PTCA-induced ischemia from BSPM recordings are presented. In the first method, an ECG inverse solution that estimates epicardial potentials from body surface signals using a realistic model of torso geometry is applied. The strength of this method lies in its potential ability to localize areas of cardiac ischemia on the epicardial surface. In the second approach, wavelet transforms were used to perform a multiresolution decomposition of the BSPM data into different frequency bands. The basis functions of the wavelet transform are time-limited and narrow band and hence can be expected to be sensitive to features of the BSPM that originate in discrete electrophysiologic events, such as intrusion of the activation front onto regions of ischemia or arrhythmias due to local conduction abnormalities. The method also offers a means of temporal and frequency localization of cardiac events related to the initiation of injury currents and abnormal conduction due to PTCA-induced ischemia. The inverse solution and the wavelet transform each offer new views of the spatial and temporal courses of acute ischemia potentially leading to new diagnostic insights in ECG patient examination.},

  abstract  = {Previous studies have examined the influence of body position, respiration, and habitus on body surface potentials. However, the authors could only estimate the sources of the effects they documented. Among the proposed origin of changes in body surface potentials from those studies were the position of the heart, alterations in autonomic tone, differences in ventricular blood volume, and variations in torso resistivity. The goal of this study was to investigate specifically the role of geometric factors in altering body surface potentials and the electrocardiogram. For this, we used experiments with an isolated, perfused dog heart suspended in a realistically shaped electrolytic torso tank. The experimental preparation allowed us to measure epicardial and tank surface potentials simultaneously, and then reconstruct the geometry of both surfaces. Our results mimicked some of the features described by previous investigators. However, our results also showed differences that included considerably larger changes in the peak QRS and T-wave amplitudes with heart movement than those reported in human studies. We detected smaller values of root-mean-squared variability from heart movements than those reported in a human study comparing body surface potentials during change in inspiration and body position. There was better agreement with relative variability, which in these studies ranged from 0.11 to 0.42, agreeing well with an estimate from human studies of 0.40. Our results suggest that the isolated heart/torso tank preparation is a valuable tool for investigating the effects of geometric variation. Furthermore, the geometric position of the heart appears to be a large source of variation in body surface potentials. The size of these variations easily exceeded thresholds used to distinguish pathologic conditions and thus such variations could have important implications on the interpretation of the standard electrocardiogram.},

In addition to visualization, which in general has been the primary reason for obtaining these data, many other uses are possible. These include modeling of different elements and their inter-relationships -- topological modeling, simulation of physical processes, analysis of movements and validation of models. In this paper, we describe some of the modeling issues from medical imaging. The issues are particularly related to topological modeling of different anatomical elements: bones, muscles, articulations, etc. A 3D topological modeler is presented with which anatomists and other users can build a topological database containing structural, topological and mechanical information of anatomical elements.},

  abstract  = {QT dispersion was originally proposed to measure spatial dispersion of ventricular recovery times. Later, it was shown that QT dispersion does not directly reflect the dispersion of recovery times and that it results mainly from variations in the T loop morphology and the error of QT measurement. The reliability of both automatic and manual measurement of QT dispersion is low and significantly lower than that of the QT interval. The measurement error is of the order of the differences between different patient groups. The agreement between automatic and manual measurement is poor. There is little to choose between various QT dispersion indices, as well as between different lead systems for their measurement. Reported values of QT dispersion vary widely, e.g., normal values from 10 to 71 ms. Although QT dispersion is increased in cardiac patients compared with healthy subjects and prognostic value of QT dispersion has been reported, values are largely overlapping, both between healthy subjects and cardiac patients and between patients with and without adverse outcome. In reality, QT dispersion is a crude and approximate measure of abnormality of the complete course of repolarization. Probably only grossly abnormal values (e.g. >= 100 ms), outside the range of measurement error may potentially have practical value by pointing to a grossly abnormal repolarization. Efforts should be directed toward established as well as new methods for assessment and quantification of repolarization abnormalities, such as principal component analysis of the T wave, T loop descriptors, and T wave morphology and wavefront direction descriptors.},

Much recent research in cardiac mapping has focused on large arrays (>200 electrodes) with small electrodes (<500 µm). Construction of such arrays using standard techniques is tedious and yields irregular electrode spacing. We present a novel construction technique that rapidly produces large arrays with regularly spaced small electrodes. For methods, fine-pitch copper ribbon cables, insulated with either polyvinylchloride (PVC) or polyimide (flexible printed circuit; FPC), were assembled together such that the active surface was the cut end of the cable. The cut end was sanded and polished, then coated with silver and sometimes silver chloride. Once completed, the alternating current (AC) root-mean-square (rms) potential was measured between two adjacent, individual electrodes. Polarization testing was conducted according to a previously reported protocol (Witkowski FX and Penkoske PA. J Electrocardiol 21: 273-282, 1988). Activation mapping was conducted in the open-chest guinea pig with both pacing- and defibrillation- strength stimuli. In terms of results, four PVC and three FPC arrays were constructed, ranging from 4 to 400 electrodes. Two hours of labor were needed to create a complete electrode array, independent of the number of electrodes, including connectors and silver/silver chloride coating. As expected, the addition of a silver/silver chloride coating significantly reduced (0.76-0.42 mV, P < 0.001) the AC rms potential difference between two electrodes. A nearly immediate recovery of the potential difference between adjacent pairs of silver/silver chloride electrodes was observed after defibrillation stimuli.},

  3. The repolarization of the theoretical action potential is triggered by the onset of \i{X1}, which becomes activated over the plateau range of potentials. \i{K2} also activates during the plateau but does not play a controlling role in the repolarization. However, \i{K2} does govern the slow pace-maker depolarization through its subsequent deactivation at negative potentials.\par
  4. The individual phases of the calculated action potential and their 'experimental' modifications were compared with published records. The upstroke is generated by a Hodgkin-Huxley type sodium conductance ($g_{Na}$), and rises with a maximum rate of 478 V/sec, somewhat less than experimentally observed values ( up to 800 V/sec). The discrepancy is discussed in relation to experimental attempts at measuring $g_{Na}$.\par

These methods use a technique called ``presaturation tagging'' to mark the myocardium, and rapid MRI to track the motion of these markers. A unique capability of this method is the production of strain images representing the local deformation of the myocardium. These images clearly show the sequence of events during the activation of the heart, and can demonstrate abnormalities caused by asynchronous electrical activation or ischemia. Coupled with the near simultaneous mapping of electrical depolarization with an epicardial sock array, we can investigate the relationship between electical activity and mechanical function on a local level. Registered fiber angle maps can be obtained in the same heart with diffusion MRI to assist in the construction of the mechano-electrical model of the whole heart.},

The aim of the present study was to obtain accurate diagnostic criteria for this prognostically important disease with the help of body surface mapping.\par
  {\em Methods and Results} -- Body surface potentials were recorded with the use of 63 unipolar leads in 45 patients with a non-Q-wave MI (41 to 75 years old); 24 healthy adults, 42 patients with unstable angina, and 70 patients with Q-wave MI served as reference groups. Qualitative pathological features of the isopotential maps, such as onset time and site and magnitude of the first right-anterior/anterior minimum, as well as pathological negativities at that time, were defined in non-Q-wave MI cases. These features, which account for the activation sequence and the body surface projections of specific cardiac regions (Selvester classification), showed a 91% sensitivity and an 88% specificity for the detection of non-Q-wave MI. In comparison, the different departure maps (first third QRS, QRS, and QRST isoarea) resulted in less favorable specificities (50% to 58%). Concordance between the isopotential maps and the acute-phase ECG (90%), hypokinesis (64%), fixed perfusion defects (59%), and significant stenosis of the infarct-related coronary artery (87%) supported the concept that these isopotential map changes correspond to the supposed sites of MI. There were pathological features in 69% of patients with unstable angina, with similar concordances as in non-Q-wave MI.\par
  {\em Conclusions} -- Isopotential maps revealed characteristic features that were suitable for the detection and localization of non-Q-wave MI in the clinical setting of unstable coronary artery disease.},

The effects of these techniques on the numerical accuracy of the computed electrical potentials are illustrated by taking a volume conductor consisting of four concentric spheres representing the head since for this model an analytical (exact) solution is available.  The techniques are of importance for numerically computed electroencephalograms (EEGs) since the numerically computed surface EEGs are severely affected by the relatively low conductivity of the compartment representing the skull.},

  abstract  = {The standard 12-lead ECG is only 50% sensitive for the detection of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The majority of leads for optimal classification of AMI probably lie outside the area covered by the 6 precordial leads. Thus, body-surface mapping (BSM) may be more helpful, as a larger thoracic area is sampled. We recorded 64-lead anterior BSMs in 635 patients with chest pain suggestive of AMI and abnormal electrocardiograms (ECGs), and 125 controls without chest pain. Of the 635 patients, 325 had AMI according to World Health Organization (WHO) criteria (203 presenting with ST segment elevation, and 122 with nondiagnostic ECG), and 310 had an "abnormal ECG but not AMI." QRS and ST-T isointegrals and variables describing map shape were derived. Subjects were randomly allocated to a training set (63 controls, 321 patients) and a validation set (62 controls, 314 patients). Multiple logistic regression was used in the training set to identify which variables gave best discrimination between groups. A model with these variables was then tested prospectively in the validation set. In stage 1 (all subjects), controls were compared with patients. In the training set, a model containing 21 variables classified 58/63 controls (specificity 92%) and 316/321 patients (sensitivity 98%). In the validation set, the model classified 48/62 controls (specificity 77.4%) and 302/314 patients (sensitivity 96%). In stage 2 (studying patients only), patients with AMI were compared with patients who had an abnormal ECG-not AMI. In the training set, a model containing 28 variables classified 132/165 patients (sensitivity 80%) with AMI and 134/156 patients (specificity 86%) with an abnormal ECG-not AMI. In the validation set, the model classified 123/160 patients (sensitivity 77%) with AMI and 131/154 patients (specificity 85%) with an abnormal ECG-not AMI. Combining results of both stages in a two-step algorithm gave an overall classification in the training set of controls 92%, abnormal ECG-not AMI 84%, AMI 80%, and in the validation set of controls 77%, abnormal ECG-not AMI 82%, AMI 74%. Thus, in conclusion, when compared with the 12-lead ECG, BSM models results in higher sensitivity and specificity for detection of AMI, particularly in patients presenting with chest pain and nondiagnostic ECG changes. The use of BSM models in such patients, may lead to the earlier detection of AMI and appropriate administration of fibrinolytic therapy and/or anti-platelet agents.},

However, RV and posterior chest leads in addition to the 12-lead electrocardiogram are required for accurate detection.

Consecutive patients with chest pain lasting <12 hours were assessed to identify those with AMI and >= 0.1 mV ST elevation in >= 2 contiguous inferior leads of the 12-lead electrocardiogram (bundle branch block or left ventricular hypertrophy excluded). A 12-lead electrocardiogram, RV leads (V_2R, V_4R), posterior chest leads (V_7, V_9), and a BSM were recorded. From each BSM, the 12 electrodes overlying the RV region (regional RV map) and 10 electrodes overlying the posterior wall (regional posterior map) were assessed for ST elevation. Infarct size was estimated by serial cardiac enzymes. AMI occurred in 173 of 479 patients. Of the 62 patients with inferior wall AMI, ST elevation >= 0.1 mV occurred in 26 patients (42%) in V_2R or V_4R compared with 36 patients (58%) in >= 1 electrode on the regional RV map (p = 0.0019).

ST elevation >= 0.05 mV occurred in 6 patients (10%) in V_7 or V_9 compared with 22 patients (36%) in >= 1 electrode on the regional posterior map (p = 0.00003). Patients with ST elevation on regional RV and/or posterior maps had a trend toward larger infarct size (mean peak creatine kinase 1,789 ± 226 vs 1,546 ± 392 mmol/L; p = NS).

As an alternative to fluoroscopy, real-time three-dimensional (3-D) ultrasound imaging has the potential to provide a safe means for tracking catheter position in 3-D while simultaneously imaging the heart's anatomy. A method is described for locating a catheter-mounted transducer in the 3-D ultrasound imaging field. The distance from the imaging transducer to the catheter transducer is measured by time of flight, while the angular position is determined by a spatial crosscorrelation of the received signals with stored receive profiles. Results from simulations with 20-dB SNR demonstrated a mean accuracy of 0.22 +/- 0.13 mm at a 70-mm range. {\em In vitro} testing showed a resolution of 0.23 +/- 0.11 mm at a range of 75 mm and a resolution of 0.47 +/- 0.47 mm at a range of 97 mm. With combined catheter position and imaging, this tracking method has the potential to replace fluoroscopy and enhance interventional procedures.},

  abstract  = {The inverse problem in electrocardiography implies the reconstruction of electrical events within the heart from information measured noninvasively on the body surface. Deduction of these electrical events is possible from measured epicardial potentials, and, thus, a noninvasive method of recovering epicardial potentials from body surface data is useful in experimental and clinical studies. In the present study, an inverse method that uses Tikhonov regularization was shown to reconstruct, with good accuracy, important events in cardiac excitation. The inverse procedure was employed on data obtained from a human-torso tank in which a beating canine heart was placed in the correct anatomical position. Comparison with the actual, measured epicardial potentials indicates that positions and shapes of potential features (maxima, minima, zero potential line, saddles, etc.) are recovered with good accuracy throughout the QRS. An error in position of up to 1 cm is typical, while amplitudes are slightly diminished. In addition, application was extended from the above setting, in which the geometry was precisely known and potentials at a large number of leads were measured accurately, to a situation that is more representative of clinical and experimental settings. Effects of inaccuracy in location of the position of the heart were examined. A stylized torso that approximates the actual geometry was designed, and its performance in the inverse computations was evaluated. A systematic method of reduction of the number of leads on the body surface was proposed, and the resulting lead configurations were evaluated in terms of the accuracy of inverse solutions. The results indicate that the inverse problem can be stabilized with respect to different types of uncertainties in measured data and offer promise in the use of the inverse procedure in clinical and experimental situations.},

Another approach is to design the amplifier in such a way that the feedthrough of high isolation mode voltage remains negligible. It is shown that an eight-channel isolation amplifier with a very good isolation mode rejection ratio can be built with commercially available components, provided that special attention is paid to the shielding of the amplifier inputs.

  abstract  = {{\em Introduction:} Cardiac tissue can be entrained when subjected to sinusoidal stimuli, often responding with action potentials sustained for the duration of the stimulus. To investigate mechanisms responsible for both entrainment and extended action potential duration, computer simulations of a two-dimensional grid of cardiac cells subjected to sinusoidal extracellular stimulation were performed.\par
  {\em Methods and Results:} The tissue is represented as a bidomain with unequal anisotropy ratios. Cardiac membrane dynamics are governed by a modified Beeler-Reuter model. The stimulus, delivered by a bipolar electrode, has a duration of 750 to 1,000 msec, an amplitude range of 800 to 3,200 \mu A/cm, and a frequency range of 10 to 60 Hz. The applied stimuli create virtual electrode polarization (VEP) throughout the sheet. The simulations demonstrate that periodic extracellular stimulation results in entrainment of the tissue. This phase-locking of the membrane potential to the stimulus is dependent on the location in the sheet and the magnitude of the stimulus. Near the electrodes, the oscillations are 1:1 or 1:2 phase-locked; at the middle of the sheet, the oscillations are 1:2 or 1:4 phase-locked and occur on the extended plateau of an action potential. The 1:2 behavior near the electrodes is due to periodic change in the voltage gradient between VEP of opposite polarity; at the middle of the sheet, it is due to spread of electrotonic current following the collision of a propagating wave with refractory tissue.\par
  {\em Conclusion:} The simulations suggest that formation of VEP in cardiac tissue subjected to periodic extracellular stimulation is of paramount importance to tissue entrainment and formation of an extended oscillatory action potential plateau.},

Recently, nonfluoroscopic catheter tracking technologies have been developed to quantitate the (degrees-of-freedom) three-dimensional positions of intracardiac catheters. This paper presents a projection-Procrustes method to register an animated three-dimensional (3-D) model of multiple intracardiac catheters with a single-plane fluoroscopic image. Applying the computed transformation to the catheter coordinates enables the animated 3-D model of the catheters to be viewed from the same perspective as the fluoroscopic image. Mathematical simulations show that the computed transformation parameters are sensitive to both the position errors in the 3-D catheter coordinates and to the spatial distribution of the catheter-mounted transducers. Simulations with a realistic geometric model of three catheters with four transducers per catheter showed an angular error of 1.91\degrees +/- 0.27\degrees for 3-D catheter position errors of 2.0 mm. An in vitro experiment demonstrated the feasibility of the method using a water tank phantom of three catheters and fluoroscopic images taken over an 80\degrees range. The mean angular error was 0.61\degrees +/- 0.48\degrees. The results of this study indicate that the projection-Procrustes method is a useful tool for registering 3-D catheter tracking models to single-plane fluoroscopic images.},

The adaptability of the approach can be used to control the quality of reconstructed signals. However, like most of other ECG compression methods, AVQ only deals with the single-channel ECG, and for the multichannel (MC) ECG, coding ECG signals on a channel by channel basis is not efficient, because the correlation across channels is not exploited. To exploit this correlation, an MC version of AVQ is proposed. In the proposed approach, the AVQ index from each channel is collected to form a new input vector. The vector is then vector quantized adaptively using one additional codebook called index codebook. Both the MIT/BIH database and a clinical Holter database are tested. The experimental results show that, for exactly the same quality of reconstructed signals, the MC-AVQ performs better than single-channel AVQ in terms of bit rate. A theoretical analysis supporting this result is also demonstrated in this paper. For the same and relatively good visual quality, the average compressed data rate/channel is reduced from 293.5 b/s using the single-channel AVQ to 238.2 b/s using the MC-AVQ in the MIT/BIH case.},

The activation time map on the endocardium as well as on the epicardium was reconstructed applying two different methods: a linearized iterative algorithm considering the nonlinear characteristic of the inverse ECG and MCG problem, and an optimization method with a regularization technique which is usually used in estimating the activation time map. Considering comparable setups for ECG and MCG mapping systems (i.e., similar effective rank of the mapping data matrix, similar signal-to-noise ratio, same quality of the coupling of anatomical and mapping data) we found that the reconstruction from ECG and MCG mapping data results in nearly the same inverse solution. MCG mapping systems with a smaller observation space show lower effective ranks and thus resulting in a less quality of the activation time map.},

On a relatively inexpensive SIMD parallel computer, a full-forward solution is obtained in minutes, using accurate thoracic detail including anisotropy if required. Because the computation is based on a volume grid with constant size voxels, it readily accepts anatomical data from classified magnetic resonance imaging scans. By using a variation of the colored successive over-relaxation iteration, our finite difference model takes full advantage of the performance of massively parallel computers. Evaluations of the accuracy and performance of the model show the practicality of using specific anatomical models to recover the electrocardiographic field distributions for individual subjects. A relatively modest parallel machine is capable of assembling and computing a specific direct inverse solution from body surface potentials within an hour of measurement, assuming the magnetic resonance imaging classification has been previously completed.},

We first show that applying a global transformation on a surface template, is equivalent to applying certain global forces on a deformable model. Second, we propose a scheme which combines the registration and free-form deformation. This globally constrained deformation model allows us to control the amount of deformation from the reference shape with a single parameter. Finally, we propose a general algorithm for performing model-based reconstruction in a robust and accurate manner.

Geometric phantoms and left ventricles of excised calf hearts, normal human subjects, and one subject each with aortic stenosis and dilated cardiomyopathy were reconstructed from three-dimensional echocardiograms. The fit between the reconstructions and true surfaces of the geometric phantoms and excised ventricles was determined. To evaluate in vivo left ventricular shape, a center axis was constructed from the centroid of the mitral annulus to the furthest endocardial point. Regional shape was evaluated as the relative distances of 16 separate myocardial segments from the center axis compared with a population-derived mean value. Global shape was evaluated as the average standard deviation from the normal value over the 16 segments. The system precisely reproduced the shapes of the phantoms and excised left ventricles (root-mean-square error between true and reconstructed surface 1.0 0.2 mm and 1.2 0.8 mm, respectively). The in vivo shape analysis differentiated the pathological from normal left ventricles.},

  abstract  = {The anisotropic material properties, irregular geometry, and specialized conduction system of the heart all affect the three-dimensional (3D) spread of electrical activation.  A limited number of research groups have tried accounting for these features in 3D conduction models to investigate more thoroughly their observations of cardiac electrical activity in 3D experimental preparations.  The full potential of these large scale conduction models, however, has not been realized because of a lack of quantitative validation with experiment.  Such validation is critical in order to use the models to predict the electrical response of the myocardium to drugs or electrical stimulation.  In this paper, a quantitative, experimental validation of paced activation in a 3D conduction model of a 3~cm ×~3~cm ×~1~cm section of the ventricular wall is presented.  Epicardial and intramural pacing stimuli were applied in the center of a 528~channel electrode plaque sutured to the left ventricle in dogs.  Unipolar electrograms were recorded at 2~kHz during and after pacing.  Fiber directions within the tissue below the electrodes were estimated histologically and from pace-mapping.  Simulated epicardial electrograms were computed for surface paced beats using our 3D bidomain model of the mapped tissue volume incorporating the measured fiber directions.  Extracellular potentials and isochronal maps resulting from paced activations in both model and experiment were directly compared.  Preliminary results demonstrate that our 3D model reproduces qualitatively such key features of the experimental data as electrogram morphologies and epicardial conduction velocities.  Though quantitative agreement between model and experiment was only moderate, the validation approach described herein is an essential first step in assessing the predictive capability of present day conduction models.},

A 3-D tissue block with unequal anisotropy and two types of fiber rotation (none and moderate) was stimulated along and across fibers via bipolar electrodes on the epicardial surface, and the resulting steady-state interstitial ($\Phi_e$) and transmembrane ($V_m$) potentials were computed. Results demonstrate that the presence of rotated fibers does not change the amount of tissue polarized by the point surface stimuli, but does cause changes in the orientation of $\Phi_e$, and $V_m$ in the depth of the tissue, away from the epicardium. Further analysis revealed a relationship between the Laplacian of $\Phi_e$, regions of virtual electrodes, and fiber orientation that was dependent upon adequacy of spatial sampling and the interstitial anisotropy. These findings help to understand the role of fiber architecture during extracellular stimulation of cardiac muscle.},

Subepicardial NE infusion caused the QRS complex to invert within a single beat (n = 35 animals, 101 observations), and the earliest epicardial activation consistently shifted to the randomly located infusion site (n = 14). This preceded right atrial activation, whereas the total ventricular epicardial activation time increased from 20 ± 4 to 50 ± 9 ms (P < 0.01). These events were accompanied by a ventricular tachycardia and a drop in left ventricular pressure, which were fully reversed after the infusion was stopped. Epicardial pacing at the infusion site mimicked all electrical and hemodynamic changes induced by NE. The arrhythmia was prevented by propranolol and abolished by cardiac sympathetic or vagal nerve stimulation. Focal automaticity was computationally reconstructed using a two-dimensional sheet of 256 × 256 resistively coupled ventricular cells, where calcium handling was abnormally high in the central region. We conclude that adrenergic stimulation to a small region of the ventricle elicits triggered automaticity and that computational reconstruction implicates calcium overload. Interventions that reduce spatial inhomogeneities of intracellular calcium may prevent this type of arrhythmia.},

  abstract  = {Our aim was to simultaneously record dense arrays of electropotential signals from the heart and body surface of a closed-chest anaesthetised pig during an acute period of regional ventricular ischaemia. After fitting a suture snare to the equatorial region of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery, an electrode sock containing 127 stainless steel contact electrodes (spaced approximately 7 mm apart) was positioned over the ventricular epicardium. The chest was re-closed and fitted an elasticated vest containing 256 ECG electrodes (spaced approximately 15 mm apart). Electrode locations were measured using a mechanical digitising arm and projected onto a customised 3D mathematical model of the porcine torso and heart. Finite element fitted body surface potential maps (BSPMs) and epicardial activation sequences were used to interpret the electropotential signals. Data were sampled at 2 kHz and recorded at 20 s intervals during a four minute period of LAD occlusion, followed by a period of reperfusion and recovery. During occlusion, propagation of epicardial activation slowed monotonically across the ischaemic region and this was clearly associated with a zone of ST segment elevation in the BSPM and Lead V$_1$ ECG, whilst the Lead II ECG remained relatively unchanged. The epicardial activation sequence had largely recovered after 60 s of reperfusion, although there was still evidence of slowed activation across the ischaemic region compared to the control. Electrocardiac activity had fully restored to its control state after six minutes of reperfusion. Simultaneous recordings of this type will provide an experimental model to be used together with our integrated computational framework to assess the accuracy and sensitivity of activation inverse ECG algorithms during normal and patho-physiological states.},

  abstract  = {Atrial fibrillation (AF) was recognized and studied extensively in the early twentieth century, but many fundamental aspects of the arrhythmia were poorly understood until quite recently. It is now recognized that AF can be initiated by a variety of mechanisms that share the ability to cause extremely rapid, irregular atrial electrical activity. Once initiated, AF causes alterations in atrial electrical properties (electrical remodeling), including both rapid functional changes and slower alterations in ion channel gene expression, which promote the maintenance of AF and facilitate reinitiation of the arrhythmia should it terminate. Electrical remodeling decreases the atrial refractory period in a heterogeneous way, thus decreasing the size and stability of potential functional atrial reentry waves and promoting multiple-circuit reentry. Whatever the initial cause of AF, electrical remodeling is likely to be a final common pathway that ultimately supervenes. Recent advances in understanding ion channel function, regulation, and remodeling at the molecular level have allowed for a much more detailed appreciation of the basic determinants of AF. Improvements in the clinical management of AF will inevitably follow the recent advances in our understanding of its detailed pathophysiology.},

All of these methods have their limitations, and the later ones may, in certain cases, afford some risk to the patient. So far, the must successful application of biomagnetic methods has been the localization of bioelectric sources in the body. Promising results have been reported, with accuracies comparable to the localization results obtained by invasive clinical methods. Considering the possible clinical use of magnetocardiographs, the localization of arrhythmogenic regions as well as selection of patients with high risk of arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death are important. Theoretically, the advantage of biomagnetic measurements over corresponding bioelectric surface potential studies is still controversial. However, in practice, the spatial resolution capability of biomagnetic methods seems to be better. In various studies, the combination of both magnetic and electric data can bring improvements in the inverse solution.},

  abstract  = {In mapping the electrical activity of the heart, interpolation of electric potentials plays two important roles. First, it permits the estimation of potentials in regions that could not be sampled or where signal quality was poor, and second, it supports the construction of isopotential lines and surfaces for visualization. The difficulty in developing robust interpolation techniques for cardiac applications lies in the abrupt change in potential in the vicinity of the activation wave front. Despite the resulting nonlinearities in spatial potential distributions, simple linear interpolation methods are the current standard and the resulting errors due to aliasing can be large if electrode spacing does not lie on the order of 0.5-2 mm--the thickness of the activation wave front. We have developed a novel interpolation method that is based on two observations specific to the spread of excitation in the heart: (1) that propagation velocity changes smoothly within a region large enough to contain several measurement electrodes and (2) that electrogram morphology varies very little in the neighborhood of each sample point except for a time shift in the potential wave forms. The resulting interpolation scheme breaks the interpolation of one highly nonlinear variable--extracellular potential--into two separate interpolations of variables with much less drastic spatial variation--activation time and electrogram morphology. We have applied this method to potentials originally recorded at 1.5 mm spacing and then subsampled at a range of densities for testing of the interpolation. The results based both on reconstruction of isopotential contour maps and statistical comparison showed significant improvement of this novel approach over standard linear techniques. The applications of the new method include improved determination of electrophysiological parameters such as spatial gradients of potential and the path of cardiac activation and recovery, estimation of electrograms at desired locations, and visualization of electric potential distributions.},

  abstract  = {Interpolation plays an important role in analyzing or visualizing any scalar field because it provides a means to estimate field values between measured sites. A specific example is the measurement of the electrical activity of the heart, either on its surface or within the muscle, a technique known as cardiac mapping, which is widely used in research. While three-dimensional measurement of cardiac fields by means of multielectrode needles is relatively common, the interpolation methods used to analyze these measurements have rarely been studied systematically. The present study addressed this need by applying three trivariate techniques to cardiac mapping and evaluating their accuracy in estimating activation times at unmeasured locations. The techniques were tetrahedron-based linear interpolation, Hardy's interpolation, and least-square quadratic approximation. The test conditions included activation times from both high-resolution simulations and measurements from canine experiments. All three techniques performed satisfactorily at measurement spacing <= 2 mm. At the larger interelectrode spacings typical in cardiac mapping (1 cm), Hardy's interpolation proved superior both in terms of statistical measures and qualitative reconstruction of field details. This paper provides extensive comparisons among the methods and descriptions of expected errors for each method at a variety of sampling intervals and conditions.},

  abstract  = {The long-term goal of electrocardiography is to relate electric potentials on the body surface with activities in the heart. Many previously reported studies have focused on direct links between heart and body surface potentials. The goals of this study were first to validate computational methods of determining volume potentials and currents with high-resolution experimental measurements and then to use interactive visualization of thoracic currents to understand features of the electrocardiographic fields from measured cardiac sources. We developed both simulation and experimental studies based on a realistic shaped torso phantom containing an isolated, perfused dog heart. Interventions included atrial pacing, single pacing and simultaneously pacing at multiple locations on the ventricles. Simulated torso volume potentials closely matched measured potentials in the torso-tank preparation (mean correlation coefficients of 0.95). Simulation further provided a means of estimating the current field in the torso from the computed torso volume potentials and the local geometric and conductive properties of the medium. Applying these techniques to the torso electric fields under a variety of pacing conditions, we have further demonstrated that thoracic current can provide many insights into the relationship between heart surface potential and body surface potentials. Specifically, we have shown that geometric factors including cardiac source configuration and location play an important role in determining to what extent electric activity in the heart is directly visible on the body surface electrocardiogram. The computation and visualization toolkit we developed in this study to explore current fields associated with cardiac events may provide new insights into electrocardiology.},

Within elements, fields are approximated using basis functions with associated parameters defined at the element nodes. Four parameters per node are used to describe ventricular geometry. The radial coordinate is interpolated using cubic Hermite basis functions that preserve slope continuity, while the angular coordinates are interpolated linearly. Two further nodal parameters describe the orientation of myocardial fibers. The orientation of fibers within coordinate planes bounded by epicardial and endocardial surfaces is interpolated linearly, with transmural variation given by cubic Hermite basis functions. Left and right ventricular geometry and myocardial fiber orientations were characterized for a canine heart arrested in diastole and fixed at zero transmural pressure. The geometry was represented by a 24-element ensemble with 41 nodes. Nodal parameters fitted using least squares provided a realistic description of ventricular epicardial [root mean square (RMS) error less than 0.9 mm] and endocardial (RMS error less than 2.6 mm) surfaces. Measured fiber fields were also fitted (RMS error less than 17 degrees) with a 60-element, 99-node mesh obtained by subdividing the 24-element mesh. These methods provide a compact and accurate anatomic description of the ventricles suitable for use in finite element stress analysis, simulation of cardiac electrical activation, and other cardiac field modeling problems.},

  abstract  = {A dual-pathway theory to explain atrioventricular-nodal (AVN) reentry has been proposed previously. However, the exact anatomical and functional correlates of the fast pathway (FP) and slow pathway (SP) have not yet been elucidated. We used optical mapping to reconstruct patterns of activation during retrograde conduction through the AVN and during AVN reentry in the triangles of Koch of 12 rabbits. Reentry was inducible by a premature stimulation of the bundle of His in 6 preparations (50%). A functional FP and SP appear to be anatomically correlated with posterior and posterolateral extensions of the AVN, which were recently described. Retrograde breakthrough points in 6 noninducible preparations were clustered near the apex of the triangle of Koch (FP), whereas 6 inducible preparations had either cycle length-dependent FP and SP exits (n=3) or only SP exits located near the coronary sinus orifice. The shift of breakthrough points from FP to SP during progressive shortening of the coupling interval was accompanied by a discontinuity in the conduction curve. We observed a transmural reentrant circuit involving the AVN, FP, SP, and the superficial endocardial layer of atrial and transitional cells. The presence of a functional SP during retrograde conduction was associated with inducibility of AVN reentry. The full text of this article is available at http://www.circresaha.org.},

Slightly different versions have been developed for peripheral regions that show a maximum diastolic potential near -75 mV and for central regions that do not hyperpolarize beyond -60 to -65 mV. Variations in extracellular potassium influence the frequency of pace-maker activity in the s.a. node model very much less than they do in the Purkinje fibre model.

Activation of the Na-K exchange pump in the model by increasing intracellular sodium can suppress pacemaker activity. This phenomenon may contribute to the mechanism of overdrive suppression.},

Our model consists of a Hodgkin-Huxley-type equivalent circuit for the sarcolemma, coupled with a fluid compartment model, which accounts for changes in ionic concentrations in the cytoplasm as well as in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This formulation can reconstruct action potential data that are representative of recordings from a majority of human atrial cells in our laboratory and therefore provides a biophysically based account of the underlying ionic currents. This work is based in part on a previous model of the rabbit atrial myocyte published by our group and was motivated by differences in some of the repolarizing currents between human and rabbit atrium. We have therefore given particular attention to the sustained outward \ionK current (\I{sus}), which putatively has a prominent role in determining the duration of the human atrial action potential. Our results demonstrate that the action potential shape during the peak and plateau phases is determined primarily by transient outward \ionK current, \I{sus}, and L-type \ionCa current (\I{Ca,L}) and that the role of \I{sus} in the human atrial action potential can be modulated by the baseline sizes of \I{Ca,L}, \I{sus}, and the rapid delayed rectifier \ionK current. As a result, our simulations suggest that the functional role of \I{sus} can depend on the physiological/disease state of the cell.},

It is assumed that this would implicate better accuracy in the EEG inverse estimates.  However, this does not necessarily hold.  The reason for this is that the electrodes create a well conducting shunting ``layer'' on the scalp which affects the voltage distribution.  This may decrease the information obtained and may therefore worsen the inverse estimates.  Electrodes in EEG inverse problems are commonly modeled as point electrodes.  This model cannot take into account the possible shunting effect of the electrodes.  In this study the measurement electrodes are modeled using the so-called complete electrode model which takes into account the actual size of the electrode, the contact impedance between the skin and the electrode and also the shunting effect of the electrodes.  In this paper the effects of the electrode size and the contact impedance on the voltage distribution are studied by simulations.  It is shown that, depending on the size and the contact impedance of the electrodes, increasing the number of electrodes does not necessarily improve the accuracy of the inverse estimates.  We also conclude that the use of the point electrode model is quite adequate in normal EEG studies.  The use of a complete electrode model is necessary if electrodes cover more than 50\% of the surface area.},

  It is now possible to generate the ascending aortic pressure wave from the arterial pressure pulse, recorded noninvasively by applanation tonometry in the radial or carotid artery. This represents a blend of nineteenth century sphygmography with cuff sphygmomanometry, and is made possible by introduction of high fidelity tonometers, by characterization of arterial hydraulic properties in the upper limb and neck, and through application of mathematical engineering techniques in modern computer systems.

  {\em Methods and Results} Local electrocardiac events were initiated by pacing a dog heart in a human torso-shaped tank. Body surface potential measurements (384 electrodes) were used to compute epicardial potentials noninvasively. The accuracy of reconstructed epicardial potentials was evaluated by direct comparison to measured ones (134 electrodes). Protocols included pacing from single sites and simultaneously from two sites with various intersite distances. Body surface potentials showed a single minimum for both single- and double-site pacing (intersite distances of 52, 35, and 17 mm). Noninvasively reconstructed epicardial electrograms, potentials, and iso-chrones closely approximated the measured ones. Single pacing sites were reconstructed to within <= 10 mm of their measured positions. Dual sites were located accurately and resolved for the above intersite distances. Regions of sparse and crowded isochrones, indicating spatial nonuniformities of epicardial activation spread, were also reconstructed.\par
  {\em Conclusions} The study demonstrates that ECGI can reconstruct epicardial potentials, electrograms, and isochrones over the entire epicardial surface during the cardiac cycle. It can provide detailed information on local activation of the heart noninvasively. Its uses could include localization of cardiac electric events (eg, ectopic foci), characterization of nonuniformities of conduction, characterization of repolarization properties (eg, dispersion), and mapping of dynamically changing arrhythmias (eg, polymorphic VT) on a beat-by-beat basis.},

  abstract  = {This study examines the use of a new regular-ization scheme, called regional regularization, for solving the electrocardiographic inverse problem.  Previous work has shown that different time frames in the cardiac cycle require varying degrees of regularization. This reflects differences in potential magnitudes, gradients, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and locations of electrical activity.  One might expect, therefore, that a single regularization parameter and a uniform level of regularization may also be insufficient for a single potential map of a single time frame because in one map there are regions of high and low potentials and potential gradients.  Regional regularization is a class of methods that subdivides a given potential map into functional regions based on the spatial characteristics of the potential (spatial frequencies).  These individual regions are regularized separately and recombined into a complete map. This paper examines the hypothesis that such regionally regularized maps are more accurate than if all regions were taken together and solved with an averaged level of regularization.  In a homogeneous concentric spheres model, Legendre polynomials are used to decompose a torso potential map into a set of submaps, each with a different degree of spatial variation. The original torso map is contaminated with data noise, or geometrical error or both, and regional regularization improves the epicardial potential reconstruction by up to 25\% [relative error (RE)].  Regional regularization also improves the reconstructed location of peaks.  A practical goal is to extend the application of this method to the realistic torso geometry, but because Legendre decomposition is limited to geometries with spherical symmetry, other methods of map decomposition must be found.  Singular value decomposition (SVD) is used to decompose the maps into component parts.  Its individual submaps also have different levels of spatial variation; moreover, it is generalizable to any vector, does not require spherical symmetry, and is extremely efficient numerically.  Using SVD decomposition for regional regularization, significant improvement was achieved in the map quality in the presence of data noise.},

  abstract  = {{\em Background} -- A recent study demonstrated the ability of electrocardiographic imaging (ECGI) to reconstruct, noninvasively, epicardial potentials, electrograms, and activation sequences (isochrones) generated by epicardial activation. The current study expands the earlier work to the three-dimensional myocardium and investigates the ability of ECGI to characterize intramural myocardial activation noninvasively and to relate it to the underlying fiber structure of the myocardium. This objective is motivated by the fact that cardiac excitation and arrhythmogenesis involve the three-dimensional ventricular wall and its anisotropic structure.\par
  {\em Methods and Results} -- Intramural activation was initiated by pacing a dog heart in a human torso tank. Body surface potentials (384 electrodes) were used to compute epicardial potentials noninvasively. Accuracy of reconstructed epicardial potentials was evaluated by direct comparison to measured ones (134 electrodes). Protocols included pacing from five intramural depths. Epicardial potentials showed characteristic patterns (1) early in activation, central negative region with two flanking maxima aligned with the orientation of fibers at the depth of pacing; (2) counterclockwise rotation of positive potentials with time for epicardial pacing, clockwise rotation for subendocardial pacing, and dual rotation for midmyocardial pacing; and (3) central positive region for endocardial pacing. Noninvasively reconstructed potentials closely approximated these patterns. Reconstructed epicardial electrograms and epicardial breakthrough times closely resembled measured ones, demonstrating progressively later epicardial activation with deeper pacing.\par
  {\em Conclusions} -- ECGI can noninvasively estimate the depth of intramyocardial electrophysiological events and provides information on the spread of excitation in the three-dimensional anisotropic myocardium on a beat-by-beat basis.},

Electrograms measured and computed are examined for purposes of identifying the time of epicardial activation (``break-through'').  The time of the activation for a given electrode is taken as the maximum -dV/dt.  There is a very good correspondence between the non-invasively computed and the measured electrograms and the break-through times.

The propagation of cardiac action potentials and their ability to form spiral waves are easily understood at a basic level when standard concepts from the theory of partial differential equations are applied. The design of computer simulations of action potential propagation is facilitated by adapting numerical concepts routinely applied by computational physicists. These concepts must be modified and combined with computer structures standard in computer science to handle the timescale and spatial scale problems unique to the action potential propagation problem. The resulting simulation shows how details of ion channel dynamics determine properties of the spiral wave, including its propagation speed, its period, its stability, and the size of the spiral core.},

The area of apposition comprised 45 +/- 1.5% (SE) of the total surface area of the diaphragm. Available data on the area of the central tendon indicate that a considerable part of the muscular part of the diaphragm is lung apposed. The curvature was linearly related to height over 7 cm of the posterior half of each hemidiaphragm. From the linear portion of this graph and assuming a vertical gradient of transdiaphragmatic pressure of 0.75 cmH_2O/cm, we applied the Laplace law and calculated tensions of 54 and 32 g/cm for right and left sides, respectively. We conclude that the shape of at least part of the posterior half of the relaxed human diaphragm in the supine position at functional residual capacity can be explained by the Laplace law, suggesting that both the lung and abdominal contents behave sufficiently as fluids so that they do not impose their shape on the diaphragm. Because diaphragm muscle is partly lung apposed, it is unlikely that the diaphragm functions simply as a piston.},

  abstract  = {Mathematical models were developed to reconstruct the action potentials (AP) recorded in epicardial and endocardial myocytes isolated from the adult rat left ventricle. The main goal was to obtain additional insight into the ionic mechanisms responsible for the transmural AP heterogeneity. The simulation results support the hypothesis that the smaller density and the slower reactivation kinetics of the \ionCa-independent transient outward \ionK current (\I{t}) in the endocardial myocytes can account for the longer action potential duration (APD), and more prominent rate dependence in that cell type. The larger density of the \ionNa current (\I{Na}) in the endocardial myocytes results in a faster upstroke ($dV/dt_{max}$). This, in addition to the smaller magnitude of \I{t}, is responsible for the larger peak overshoot of the simulated endocardial AP. The prolonged APD in the endocardial cell also leads to an enhanced amplitude of the sustained \ionK current (\I{ss}), and a larger influx of \ionCa ions via the L-type \ionCa current (\I{CaL}). The latter results in an increased sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) load, which is mainly responsible for the higher peak systolic value of the \ionCa transient $[\ionCa]_i$, and the resultant increase in the \ionNa-\ionCa exchanger (\I{NaCa}) activity, associated with the simulated endocardial AP. In combination, these calculations provide novel, quantitative insights into the repolarization process and its naturally occurring transmural variations in the rat left ventricle.},

The finite element software employed was a version for electrokinetics problems of Finite Element for Heat Transfer (FEHT) and the authors assessed the effects upon the efficacy of transcutaneous cardiac pacing of several electrode placements and sizes.  To minimize pain in the chest wall and still be able to capture the heart, the authors minimized the ratio, R, between the current density in the thoracic wall (which causes pain) and the current density in the heart wall (which captures the heart).  The best placement of the negative electrode was over the cardiac apex.  The best placement of the positive electrode was under the right scapula, although other placements mere nearly as good.  The efficiency of pacing increased as electrode size increased up to 70 cm and showed little improvement for larger areas.  Between different configurations of the precordial electrodes V1, V2, ..., V6 the most efficient configuration to pace with was V1 and V2 positive and V5 and V6 negative.  A more efficient configuration uses an auxiliary electrode located at the right subscapular region.},

For the same electrode placements and sizes and the same injected current, the finite element analysis produced results in good agreement with the experimental data.  For the optimization of defibrillation, the authors tested 12 different electrode placements and seven different electrode sizes.  The finite element analyses showed that the anterior-posterior electrode placement and an electrode size of about 90 cm$^2$ offered the least chance of potential myocardial damage and required a shock energy of less than 350 J for 5-ms defibrillation pulses to achieve 100% critical mass.  For comparison, the average cross-sectional area of the heart is $\approx 48$ cm$^2$, about half of the optimal area.  A second best electrode placement was with the defibrillation electrodes on the midaxillary lines under the armpits.  Although this placement had higher chances of producing cardiac damage, it required less shock energy to achieve 100% critical mass.},

  abstract  = {Previously, using an animal model of T-wave alternans in structurally normal myocardium, we demonstrated that repolarization can alternate with opposite phase between neighboring myocytes (ie, discordant alternans), causing spatial dispersions of repolarization that form the substrate for functional block and reentrant ventricular fibrillation (VF). However, the mechanisms responsible for cellular discordant alternans and its electrocardiographic manifestation (ie, T-wave alternans) in patients with structural heart disease are unknown. We hypothesize that electrotonic uncoupling between neighboring regions of cells by a structural barrier (SB) is a mechanism for discordant alternans. Using voltage-sensitive dyes, ventricular action potentials were recorded from 26 Langendorff-perfused guinea pig hearts in the absence (ie, control) and presence of an insulating SB produced by an epicardial laser lesion. Quantitative analysis of magnitude and phase of cellular alternans revealed that in controls, action potential duration alternated in phase at all ventricular sites above a critical heart rate (269±17 bpm), ie, concordant alternans. Also, above a faster critical heart rate threshold (335±24 bpm), action potential duration alternated with opposite phase between sites, ie, discordant alternans. In contrast, only discordant but not concordant alternans was observed in 80% of hearts with the SB, and discordant alternans always occurred at a significantly slower heart rate (by 68±28 bpm) compared with controls. Therefore, the SB had a major effect on the alternans-heart rate relation, which served to facilitate the development of discordant alternans. Whether a SB was present or not, discordant alternans produced considerable increases (by $\approx$ 170%) in the maximum spatial gradient of repolarization, which in turn formed the substrate for unidirectional block and reentry. However, by providing a structural anchor for stable reentry, discordant alternans in the presence of a SB led most often to sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia rather than to VF, whereas in the absence of a SB discordant alternans caused VF. SBs facilitate development of discordant alternans between cells with different ionic properties by electrotonically uncoupling neighboring regions of myocardium. This may explain why arrhythmia-prone patients with structural heart disease exhibit T-wave alternans at lower heart rates. These data also suggest a singular mechanism by which T-wave alternans forms a substrate for initiation of both VF and sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia.},

The two main causes of right ventricular tachycardia are arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD) and idiopathic right ventricular tachycardia (IRVT) originating from the outflow tract. This study was carried out to determine whether body-surface QRST integral mapping can differentiate patients with ARVD from patients with IRVT.\par
  {\em Methods and Results} Body-surface QRST integral maps were obtained during sinus rhythm in 8 patients with ARVD, 8 patients with IRVT, and 27 healthy control subjects. QRST integral maps were analyzed both visually and mathematically. All control subjects had a normal dipolar QRST integral map. In all patients with ARVD, a specific dipolar QRST integral map with an abnormally large negative area covering the entire inferior and right anterior thorax was recorded. In 6 of 8 patients with IRVT, a normal map pattern was found, whereas the remaining 2 patients showed an abnormally large negative area on the right anterior thorax.\par
  {\em Conclusions} Patients with ARVD display a specific abnormal QRST integral map that may be related to delayed repolarization in the structurally abnormal right ventricle. The majority of patients with IRVT demonstrate a normal QRST integral map. A slightly abnormal QRST integral map was noted in 2 of 8 patients with IRVT, which may be related to minor structural abnormalities, undetectable by the present routine diagnostic techniques. These preliminary results indicate that body-surface QRST integral mapping may become an important diagnostic tool to differentiate patients with ARVD from those with IRVT.},

An integrated 3-phase mapping approach was used, consisting of the successive application of online 62-lead body surface QRS integral mapping, directed regional paced body surface QRS integral mapping, and local activation sequence mapping. Mapping phase 1 was localization of the segment of VT origin by comparing the VT QRS integral map with a database of mean paced QRS integral maps. Mapping phase 2 was body surface pace mapping during sinus rhythm in the segment localized in phase 1 until the site at which the paced QRS integral map matched the VT QRS integral map was identified (ie, VT exit site). Mapping phase 3 was local activation sequence mapping at the circumscribed area identified in phase 2 to identify the site with the earliest local endocardial activation (ie, site of VT origin). This site became the ablation target. Ten VTs were ablated in the right ventricular outflow tract, 2 at the basal LV septum, and 7 at the midapical posterior left ventricle. A high long-term ablation success (mean follow-up duration, 14±9 months) was achieved in 17 of the 19 patients (89%) with a low number of RF pulses (mean, 3.3±2.2 pulses per patient).\par

These models can be thought of as nonlinear filters whose input is some applied current $I$ (possibly zero) and output is a membrane potential $V$. A natural question to ask is if the applied current $I$ can be deduced from the potential $V$. For a surprisingly large class of models the answer to this question is yes. To show this, we first demonstrate how many models can be embedded into higher dimensional quasilinear systems. For quasilinear models, a procedure for determining the inverse of the nonlinear filter is then described and demonstrated on two models: (1) the FitzHugh-Nagumo model and (2) the Sherman-Rinzel-Keizer (SRK) [Sherman {\em et al.}(1988), {\em Biophysics Journal}, {\bf 54}, 411-425)] model of bursting electrical activity in pancreatic \beta-cells. For the latter example, the inverse problem is then used to deduce model parameter values for which the model and experimental data agree in some measure.

  abstract  = {This study was performed to evaluate the changes in magnetocardiographic (MCG) source localization results when the geometry and the topology of the volume conductor model mere altered. Boundary element volume conductor models of three patients were first constructed. These so-called reference torso models were then manipulated to mimic various sources of error in the measurement and analysis procedures. Next, equivalent current dipole localizations were calculated from simulated and measured multichannel MCG data. The localizations obtained with the reference models were regarded as the "gold standard." The effect of each modification was investigated by calculating three-dimensional distances from the gold standard localizations to the locations obtained with the modified model. The results show that the effect of the lungs and the intra-ventricular blood masses is significant for deep source locations and, therefore, the torso model should preferably contain internal inhomogeneities. However, superficial sources could be localized within a few millimeters even with nonindividual, so called standard torso models. In addition, the torso model should extend long enough in the pelvic region, and the positions of the lungs and the ventricles inside the model should be known in order to obtain accurate localizations.},

  abstract  = {Cardiac tissue has been shown to function as an electrical syncytium in both intracellular and extracellular (interstitial) domains. Available experimental evidence and qualitative intuition about the complex anatomical structure support the viewpoint that different (average) conductivities are characteristic of the direction along the fiber axis, as compared with the cross-fiber direction, in intracellular as well as extracellular space. This report analyzes two-dimensional anisotropic cardiac tissue and achieves integral equations for finding intracellular and extracellular potentials, longitudinal currents, and membrane currents directly from a given description of the transmembrane voltage. These mathematical results are used as a basis for a numerical model of realistic (though idealized) two-dimensional cardiac tissue. A computer simulation based on the numerical model was executed for conductivity patterns including nominally normal ventricular muscle conductivities and a pattern having the intra- or extracellular conductivity ratio along $x$, the reciprocal of that along $y$. The computed results are based on assuming a simple spatial distribution for $V_m$, usually a circular isochrone, to isolate the effects on currents and potentials of variations in conductivities without confounding propagation differences. The results are in contrast to the many reports that explicity or implicitly assume isotropic conductivity or equal conductivity ratios along $x$ and $y$. Specifically, with reciprocal conductivities, most current flows in large loops encompassing several millimeters, but only in the resting (polarized) region of the tissue; further, a given current flow path often includes four or more rather than two transmembrane excursions. The nominally normal results showed local currents predominantly with only two transmembrane passages; however, a substantial part of the current flow patterns in two-dimensional anisotropic bisyncytia may have qualitative as well as quantitative properties entirely different from those of one-dimensional strands.},

Suprathreshold effects are determined for two examples by extending the analytical results with a numerical model. The $v_m$, response is a complex evolution in time, especially for small $h$, that differs markedly from the ``activating function''. In general, the subthreshold response is a good predictor of the wave shape of the suprathreshold $v_m$ but a poor predictor of its magnitude. The subthreshold response also is a good (but not a precise) predictor of the region where excitation begins.},

Parallel speedups measured with each scheme were compared to theoretical speedups, recognizing the relationship between speedup and code portions that executed serially. A data decomposition scheme based on total ionic current provided the best performance. Analysis of communication latencies in that scheme led to a load-balancing algorithm in which measured speedups at 89 +/- 2% and 75 +/- 8% of theoretical speedups were achieved in homogeneous and heterogeneous clusters of workstations. Speedups in this scheme with the Luo-Rudy dynamic membrane equations exceeded 3.0 with 8 distributed workstations. Cluster speedups were comparable to those measured during parallel execution on a shared memory machine.},

In each case, three consecutive inflations of relatively short duration (37 +/- 14 seconds) were carried out. Electrical activity was displayed as unipolar electrograms and body surface potential maps. The total QRS complex duration decreased in 14 of the 20 patients. Focal conduction disturbances were observed in six cases; all six had left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion and two were also accompanied by a clear shortening of the right epicardial breakthrough time. In these two cases, an initial activation loss seemed to be characteristic, whereas in the other four cases, a rather diffuse slowing of intraventricular conduction, especially during the terminal portion of the QRS, could be observed. Individual and group mean isointegral difference body surface potential maps (during-minus-before dilation) were considered valuable for the interpretation of localized changes in intraventricular conduction during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, and their individual variations could, at least partly, be explained by the presence or absence of collateral circulation. Two different hypotheses are suggested to account for the QRS complex shortening observed during short-term myocardial ischemic injury: (1) coronary artery occlusion delayed activation of the portion of the septal region that is normally activated early during the QRS, and/or (2) coronary artery occlusion increased the speed of propagation within the ventricles. Both of these hypotheses are discussed in light of earlier clinical and experimental results.},

  abstract  = {Patients with severe heart failure are at high risk of sudden cardiac death. In the majority of these patients, sudden cardiac death is thought to be due to ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Alterations of the electric properties of single myocytes in heart failure may favor the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias in these patients by inducing early or delayed afterdepolarizations. Mathematical models of the cellular action potential and its underlying ionic currents could help to elucidate possible arrhythmogenic mechanisms on a cellular level. In the present study, selected ionic currents based on human data are incorporated into a model of the ventricular action potential for the purpose of studying the cellular electrophysiological consequences of heart failure. Ionic currents that are not yet sufficiently characterized in human ventricular myocytes are adopted from the action potential model developed by Luo and Rudy (LR model). The main results obtained from this model are as follows: The action potential in ventricular myocytes from failing hearts is longer than in nonfailing control hearts. The major underlying mechanisms for this prolongation are the enhanced activity of the \ionNa-\ionCa exchanger, the slowed diastolic decay of the $[\ionCa]_i$ transient, and the reduction of the inwardly rectifying \ionK current and the \ionNa-\ionK pump current in myocytes of failing hearts. Furthermore, the fast and slow components of the delayed rectifier \ionK current (\I{Kr} and \I{Ks}, respectively) are of utmost importance in determining repolarization of the human ventricular action potential. In contrast, the influence of the transient outward \ionK current on APD is only small in both cell groups. Inhibition of \I{Kr} promotes the development of early afterdepolarizations in failing, but not nonfailing, myocytes. Furthermore, spontaneous \ionCa release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum triggers a premature action potential only in failing myocytes. This model of the ventricular action potential and its alterations in heart failure is intended to serve as a tool for investigating the effects of therapeutic interventions on the electric excitability of the human ventricular myocardium.},

Besides its limited accuracy and reproducibility, it does not provide information on the morphology of the T wave; thus, morphologic alterations such as notches can be only qualitatively described but not objectively quantified.\par
  {\em Methods and Results} To measure the complexity of repolarization in the long-QT syndrome (LQTS) patients, we previously applied principal component analysis to body surface mapping and found it useful in distinguishing normal from abnormal repolarization patterns (sensitivity, 87%). In the present study, we applied principal component analysis to 12-lead Holter recordings. The index of complexity of repolarization that we have developed (CR24h) reflects the average 24-hour complexity of repolarization and is mathematically defined as the average ratio between the second and the first eigenvalue. We studied 36 LQTS patients and 40 control subjects. A mean of 22±1.3 ECG recordings at 1-hour intervals was used in each patient, and a total of 1655 recordings were analyzed. CR24h was significantly higher in LQTS than in control subjects (34±12% versus 13±3%; P<.0001). A CR24h exceeding 2 SD above the mean of the control group (>20%) was present in 32 of 36 patients (88%). The negative predictive value of CR24h in LQTS was 88%, and the combination of prolonged QT and abnormal CR24h identified all LQTS patients from normal subjects, including 4 affected symptomatic individuals with a normal QT interval duration, suggesting that CR24h provides information independent of QT duration.\par
  {\em Conclusions} Our data suggest that principal component analysis applied to 24-hour, 12-lead Holter recording adequately quantifies the complexity of ventricular repolarization and may become a useful noninvasive diagnostic tool in LQTS.},

  abstract  = {The aim of this work is to begin quantifying the performance of a recently developed activation imaging algorithm of Huiskamp and Greensite. We present here the modeling and computational issues associated with this process. First, we present a practical construction of the appropriate transfer matrix relating an activation sequence to body surface potentials from a general boundary value problem point of view. This approach makes explicit the role of different Green's functions and elucidates features (such as the anisotropic versus isotropic distinction) not readily apparent from alternative formulations. A new analytic solution is then developed to test the numerical implementation associated with the transfer matrix formulation presented here and convergence results for both potentials and normal currents are given. Next, details of the construction of a generic porcine model using a nontraditional data-fitting procedure are presented. The computational performance of this model is carefully examined to obtain a mesh of an appropriate resolution to use in inverse calculations. Finally, as a test of the entire approach, we illustrate the activation inverse procedure by reconstructing a known activation sequence from simulated data. For the example presented, which involved two ectopic focii with large amounts of Gaussian noise (100 µV rms) present in the torso signals, the reconstructed activation sequence had a similarity index of 0.880 when compared to the input source.},

The mechanism of this phenomenon (defibrillation) is not known. The principal difficulty, as shown in experiments and confirmed by classical cable theory, is that the changes in transmembrane potential, $e$, induced by electric field, decay exponentially with distance from the electrodes.\par
  We study wave suppression by an electric field in generic excitable media. In excitable media consisting of separate cells (similar to biological tissues), we have found a suppression of rotating waves and defibrillation induced by strong electric field, contrary to what happens in continuous media. We show that the spatially periodic component of $e$ which arises in cellular media is responsible for defibrillation. We have found that (i) it does not decay with distance; (ii) it can excite quiescent cells and terminate excitation in excited cells; (iii) the coupling between cardiac cells is a crucial parameter affecting the amplitude of the spatially periodic component of $e$, and the efficiency of defibrillation. New experiments on cardiac muscle are proposed.},

The objectives were (1) to define a set of parameters capable of quantifying the spatial and temporal changes in measured extracellular potentials associated with localized ischemia prior to the onset of conduction block; (2) to elevate regional levels of extracellular potassium ion concentration and quantify potential changes due to this known physiologic manipulation; and (3) to use quantitative parameters to make statistical comparisons in order to distinguish wave fronts during normal, ischemic and hyperkalemic conditions. Results showed that the parameters of wave number and average temporal frequency and the associated power, as determined from the wave number spectrum, provided statistically significant (p<0.05) quantification of changes in wave front features during normal and ischemic or hyperkalemic conditions. The results were consistent with results obtained from conventional time-space domain methods like isochronal mapping and electrograms, with the advantage of a quantitative result enabling simple comparisons and trend analysis for large numbers of heart beats.},

This study used two spatial methods of excitation time determination in attempt to improve assessment of excitation times in areas where the time derivative of the unipolar EG has multiple minima. The maximum magnitude of the spatial gradient ($\nabla V$) of the potential field and the zero crossing of the time course of the Laplacian ($\nabla^2 V$) of the potentials were used as alternate means of excitation time determination. Epicardial potentials were recorded from electrode arrays of 525 and 744 sites at 1 mm and 2 mm uniform spacing during epicardial, ventricular pacing. Isochronal maps were generated using all 3 methods. The average difference in excitation times when comparing the time derivative method with the spatial gradient was 0.7+/-1.8 msec ($R^2$=0.98) and 0.6+/-2.0 ($R^2$=0.97) when compared to the Laplacian method for all leads where no fractionation was observed (n=1190). For leads where multiple-peaked time derivatives were observed the differences in the excitation times between the temporal and the spatial methods ranged from -11 to 16 ms ($R^2$=0.89). In conclusion, the spatial gradient and Laplacian approaches to excitation time determination are highly correlated with the temporal method and for cases of multi-peaked time derivatives, can provide results that agree with those from isopotential maps and conduction velocity measurements.},

Results are presented in the form of isopotential and isofield maps and are also compared to the maps of a dipole in a semi-infinite homogenous model in the context of single dipole inverse solutions. The inclusion of the boundaries has a large effect on the magnitudes of the maps and modest effects on their topology. The electric and magnetic maps show similar responses to the boundaries for X (leftward) and Y (upward) directed dipoles. The electric maps of Z (back-to-front) dipoles are comparatively unaffected by the boundaries, unlike the magnetic maps of Z dipoles, to which the outer boundary makes a substantial contribution.

We examined the importance of the restitution of action potential duration (APD) and of conduction velocity (CV) to the stability of spiral wave reentry in a two-dimensional sheet of simulated cardiac tissue. The Luo-Rudy ventricular action potential model was modified to eliminate its restitution properties, which are caused by deactivation or recovery from inactivation of \ionK, \ionCa, and \ionNa currents (\I{K}, \I{Ca}, and \I{Na}, respectively). In this model, we find that 1) restitution of \I{Ca} and \I{Na} are the main determinants of the steepness of APD restitution; 2) for promoting spiral breakup, the range of diastolic intervals over which the APD restitution slope is steep is more important than the maximum steepness; 3) CV restitution promotes spiral wave breakup independently of APD restitution; and 4) ``defibrillation'' of multiple spiral wave reentry is most effectively achieved by combining an antifibrillatory intervention based on altering restitution with an antitachycardia intervention. These findings suggest a novel paradigm for developing effective antiarrhythmic drugs.},

  abstract  = {{\em Background} -- T-wave alternans, which is associated with the genesis of cardiac fibrillation, has recently been related to discordant action potential duration (APD) alternans. However, the cellular electrophysiological mechanisms responsible for discordant alternans are poorly understood.\par
  {\em Methods and Results} -- We simulated a 2D sheet of cardiac tissue using phase 1 of the Luo-Rudy cardiac action potential model. A steep (slope >1) APD restitution curve promoted concordant APD alternans and T-wave alternans without QRS alternans. When pacing was from a single site, discordant APD alternans occurred only when the pacing rate was fast enough to engage conduction velocity (CV) restitution, producing both QRS and T-wave alternans. Tissue heterogeneity was not required for this effect. Discordant alternans markedly increases dispersion of refractoriness and increases the ability of a premature stimulus to cause localized wavebreak and induce reentry. In the absence of steep APD restitution and of CV restitution, sustained discordant alternans did not occur, but reentry could be induced if there was marked electrophysiological heterogeneity. Both discordant APD alternans and preexisting APD heterogeneity facilitate reentry by causing the waveback to propagate slowly.\par
  {\em Conclusion} -- Discordant alternans arises dynamically from APD and CV restitution properties and markedly increases dispersion of refractoriness. Preexisting and dynamically induced (via restitution) dispersion of refractoriness independently increase vulnerability to reentrant arrhythmias. Reduction of dynamically induced dispersion by appropriate alteration of electrical restitution has promise as an antiarrhythmic strategy.},

We found that APD restitution is the major determinant of scroll wave behavior and that instabilities arising from APD restitution are the main determinants of scroll wave breakup in this cardiac model. We did not see a ``thickness-induced instability'' in the LR1 model, but a minimum thickness is required for scroll breakup in the presence of fiber rotation. The major effect of fiber rotation is to maintain twist in a scroll wave, promoting filament bending and thus scroll breakup. In addition, fiber rotation induces curvature in the scroll wave, which weakens conduction and further facilitates wave break.},

Because the heart is located within the torso volume conductor, body surface potentials also reflect the effects of torso inhomogeneities, which include blood, lungs, bone, muscle, fat, and fluid. It is necessary to characterize and understand these effects in order to interpret BSPM and ECG in terms of cardiac activity without ``contamination'' from the inhomogeneous volume conductor.\par

Accurate geometry of the torso inhomogeneities was digitized from the Visual Human Project and appropriately introduced into a computer model of the tank setup. The geometry and electrical properties of the volume conductor could be varied. Both homogeneous and inhomogeneous torsos have major smoothing effects on BSPM, which is of very low resolution compared with its corresponding epicardial potential pattern. Relative to a homogeneous torso, the inhomogeneities have only a minor effect on BSPM patterns. They augment potential magnitudes depending on the pattern of epicardial activation. Variations of geometry and electrical properties within the normal physiologic range have minimal effects.\par

The inhomogeneous model was used to compute BSPMs from the measured epicardial potentials. These BSPMs were the starting point for inverse computations in the different torso models. Epicardial potential maps, EGMs, and isochrones were computed. The homogeneous model produced slightly less accurate epicardial potential reconstructions than the inhomogeneous model and stylized lung model, but epicardial potential patterns, EGMs, isochrones, and locations of pacing sites were reconstructed with comparable accuracy when torso inhomogeneities were ignored.\par
  {\em Conclusion:} The results demonstrate that, in the clinical application, it is not necessary to include torso inhomogeneities for noninvasive reconstructions of epicardial potentials, EGMs, and activation sequences.},

  abstract  = {Dogs have been used extensively to study atrial arrhythmias, but there are no published mathematical models of the canine atrial action potential (AP). To obtain insights into the ionic mechanisms governing canine atrial AP properties, we incorporated formulations of \ionK, \ionNa, \ionCa, and $Cl^-$  currents, based on measurements in canine atrial myocytes, into a mathematical model of the AP. The rate-dependent behavior of model APs corresponded to experimental measurements and pointed to a central role for L-type \ionCa current inactivation in rate adaptation. Incorporating previously described regional ionic current variations into the model largely reproduced AP forms characteristic of the corresponding right atrial regions (appendage, pectinate muscle, crista terminalis, and atrioventricular ring). When ionic alterations induced by tachycardia-dependent remodeling were incorporated, the model reproduced qualitatively the AP features constituting the cellular substrate for atrial fibrillation. We conclude that this ionic model of the canine atrial AP agrees well with experimental measurements and gives potential insights into mechanisms underlying functionally important electrophysiological phenomena in canine atrium.},

We deployed a custom catheter in the dog RA, which consisted of a cylindrical probe with 64 electrodes on its surface, for measuring noncontact cavitary electrograms, and a concentric endocardial basket carrying an additional array of 64 electrodes, for measuring contact endocardial electrograms (the ``gold standard''). Both a 5-mm- and a 10-mm-diam probe (P5 and P10, respectively) were sequentially tested in the same RA of one dog. Unipolar electrograms from both the probe and the basket were simultaneously acquired during normal as well as during paced rhythms (n >= 24 protocols per probe). Boundary element method and numeric regularization were applied to compute endocardial electrograms at the basket electrode locations. We found that noncontact electrograms were attenuated and smoothed, and this effect was exaggerated with the small probe. Computed endocardial electrograms more accurately reconstructed important amplitude distribution and morphological features; peak-to-peak amplitude error, 35% for P5 and 34% for P10. Activation and spatial errors of computed endocardial electrograms were 8.8±6.8 ms and 5.1±6.1 mm for P5, respectively, and 6.0±5.5 ms and 3.2±4.4 mm for P10, respectively. In conclusion, global RA activation may be delineated directly from noncontact cavitary electrograms alone, but may be affected by volume attenuation, smoothing, and probe size. Accurate endocardial electrograms, however, can be successfully computed from noncontact electrograms acquired with small probes and be used to reconstruct both electrogram amplitude and detailed morphology.},

It is assumed that no spatial [\ionCa] gradients exist in this volume, and that each FRU acts independently. The model is amenable to systematic parameter studies in which FRU dynamics are simulated at the channel level using Monte Carlo methods with \ionCa concentrations simulated by numerical integration of a coupled system of differential equations. Using stochastic methods, \ionCa-induced \ionCa release (CICR) shows both high gain and graded \ionCa release that is robust when parameters are varied. For a single DHPR opening, the resulting RyR \ionCa release flux is insensitive to the DHPR open duration, and is determined principally by local sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) \ionCa load, consistent with experimental data on \ionCa sparks. In addition, single RyR openings are effective in triggering \ionCa release from adjacent RyRs only when open duration is long and SR \ionCa load is high. This indicates relatively low coupling between RyRs, and suggests a mechanism that limits the regenerative spread of RyR openings. The results also suggest that adaptation plays an important modulatory role in shaping \ionCa release duration and magnitude, but is not solely responsible for terminating \ionCa release. Results obtained with the stochastic model suggest that high gain and gradedness can occur by the recruitment of independent FRUs without requiring spatial [\ionCa] gradients within a functional unit or cross-coupling between adjacent functional units.},

The models were constructed by assuming different subsets of three putative cooperative mechanisms. Cooperative mechanism 1 holds that cross-bridge binding increases the affinity of troponin for \ionCa. In the models, cooperative mechanism 1 can produce steep force-\ionCa (F-Ca) relations, but apparent cooperativity is highest at midlevel \ionCa concentrations. During twitches, cooperative mechanism 1 has the effect of increasing latency to peak as the magnitude of force increases, an effect not seen experimentally. Cooperative mechanism 2 holds that the binding of a cross bridge increases the rate of formation of neighboring cross bridges and that multiple cross bridges can maintain activation of the thin filament in the absence of \ionCa. Only cooperative mechanism 2 can produce sarcomere length (SL)-dependent prolongation of twitches, but this mechanism has little effect on steady-state F-\ionCa relations. Cooperativity mechanism 3 is designed to simulate end-to-end interactions between adjacent troponin and tropomyosin. This mechanism can produce steep F-\ionCa relations with appropriate SL-dependent changes in \ionCa sensitivity. With the assumption that tropomyosin shifting is faster than cross-bridge cycling, cooperative mechanism 3 produces twitches where latency to peak is independent of the magnitude of force, as seen experimentally.},

  abstract  = {This study employs two modeling approaches to investigate short-term interval-force relations. The first approach is to develop a low-order, discrete-time model of excitation-contraction coupling to determine which parameter combinations produce the degree of postextrasystolic potentiation seen experimentally. Potentiation is found to increase 1) for low recirculation fraction, 2) for high releasable fraction, i.e., the maximum fraction of \ionCa released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) given full restitution, and 3) for strong negative feedback of the SR release on sarcolemmal \ionCa influx. The second modeling approach is to develop a more detailed single ventricular cell model that simulates action potentials, \ionCa-handling mechanisms, and isometric force generation by the myofilaments. A slow transition from the adapted state of the ryanodine receptor produces a gradual recovery of the SR release and restitution behavior. For potentiation, a small extrasystolic release leaves more \ionCa in the SR but also increases the SR loading by two mechanisms: 1) less \ionCa-induced inactivation of L-type channels and 2) reduction of action potential height by residual activation of the time-dependent delayed rectifier K+ current, which increases \ionCa influx. The cooperativity of the myofilaments amplifies the relatively small changes in the \ionCa transient amplitude to produce larger changes in isometric force. These findings suggest that short-term interval-force relations result mainly from the interplay of the ryanodine receptor adaptation and the SR \ionCa loading, with additional contributions from membrane currents and myofilament activation.},

An important question concerns the relation between such variations and the propagation velocity and extracellular potentials. This problem was studied here in a sheet of cells, under conditions of uniform intracellular anisotropic resistivity and constant electrical membrane properties, through a numerical solution of the two-dimensional propagation equation. The numerical solution implies a lumping of the cytoplasmic and intercellular resistances into an equivalent junctional resistance to form a distributed resistive network representing the intracellular domain. The interstitial space is assumed isotropic and unbounded, with a resistivity of 100 \Omega cm. The electrical properties of the cell membrane are represented by a Beeler-Reuter model. The stimulus current is applied to a small area of the sheet, and attention is focussed on the stable propagated events occurring some 5 or 6 length constants away from the stimulation site. The numerical solution is a good approximation of a continuous uniform structure when the cell size is less than 10% of the length constant along both major axes. Conditions of non-uniform propagation, with directionally dependent variations in the maximum rate of rise and time constant of the foot of the action potential were simulated by increasing the cell size to 30% of the length constant in the transverse direction of the sheet. Our results indicate that the directional changes in the maximum rate of rise correspond to small modifications of the extracellular potentials, while the directional changes in time constant of the foot are associated with the propagation velocity. The maximum effects are observed along the transverse direction as follows: a 19% increase in maximum rate of rise corresponds to a decrease of about 6% in the peak-to-peak amplitude of the extracellular potential, and a 24% increase in time constant of the foot is associated with a decrease of about 7% in the propagation velocity. Under the conditions of the present study, however, the simulated directional changes in maximum rate of rise are smaller than those experimentally observed so the corresponding changes in the extracellular potentials are probably underestimated.},

Such measures have many potential applications, for example, assessing the effects of time, drugs, or electrical interventions. We have developed a new framework for quantifying VF patterns as mapped from an array of approximately 500 unipolar electrodes. Individual activation wavefronts are isolated from one another using an algorithm that groups together adjacent active electrogram samples (dV/dt < -0.5 V/sec). Contacts between wavefronts are detected: these include fractionations, in which a single wavefront breaks into multiple wavefronts, and collisions, in which multiple wavefronts coalesce to form a new wavefront. The timing and contact relationships between wavefronts are summarized as a directed graph. From this model of the VF episode, we derive several parameters: number of wavefronts, number of fractionations, number of collisions, mean wavefront size, mean area swept out, and mean duration. As an example of this analysis, we computed these parameters in six open-chest pigs at 5, 10, 15, and 20 sec after electrical induction of VF. The number of wavefronts and the number of collisions decreased, whereas the mean wavefront size and mean area swept out increased during this period. These results are consistent with previous studies showing a recovery of organization during the first minute of VF.},

A correlation technique is used to compute the similarity between all possible pairs of the isolated wavefronts.

We define multiplicity (M) as the number of clusters needed to account for 90% of the total activations in the VF episode. M measures the complexity of the rhythm. In repetitive patterns (e.g., sinus rhythm), M = 1, indicating that the same morphology repeatedly activates the mapped region. Typically, in VF, M > 1, with larger numbers representing more complex, disorganized patterns. As an example, we computed M at 5, 10, 15, and 20 sec after electrical induction of VF in six pigs.

  abstract  = {Functional reentry has been hypothesized to be an underlying mechanism of ventricular fibrillation (VF); however, its contribution to activation patterns during fully developed VF is unclear. We applied new quantitative pattern analysis techniques to mapping data acquired from a 21x24 unipolar electrode array (2-mm spacing) located on the ventricular epicardium of 7 open-chest, unsupported pigs. Data epochs 4 seconds long beginning 1, 10, 20, 30, and 40 seconds after electrical induction were analyzed. Reentrant circuits were automatically identified and quantified. We found that 2.3% of activation pathways could unambiguously be classified as reentrant. From scaling analysis, an additional 28% of the pathways may also have been reentrant. Reentry was short-lived with 1.5±1.5 (mean±SD) complete cycles per circuit. The fraction of reentrant pathways, number of cycles per circuit, cycle duration, and area and perimeter of the cores all increased significantly as VF progressed. Core drift speed decreased significantly. Neither the orientation of the cores nor the direction of drift was well predicted by the epicardial fiber orientation (r2=0.108 and 0.138, respectively, by linear regression). Reentrant circuits were clustered in regions of the epicardium. We conclude the following: (1) Epicardial reentry is relatively uncommon and short-lived during VF, suggesting either that sustained reentry is transmural or that mechanisms governing sustained reentry are relatively unimportant to the dynamics of VF. (2) Reentrant circuits become more common, larger, and longer-lived as VF progresses, which may explain a recently observed increase in VF organization during the first minute of VF. (3) The conditions necessary to induce and sustain reentry are distributed nonuniformly.},

  abstract  = {{\em Introduction:} The mechanisms that maintain ventricular fibrillation (VF) are not completely understood. It has been proposed that increased ventricular wall thickness destabilizes VF wavefronts and therefore is an important determinant of VF activation patterns. We hypothesized that if this is the case, then VF patterns on the thin-walled right ventricle (RV) should be simpler than those on the thick-walled left ventricle (LV).\par
  {\em Methods and Results:} In seven open chest pigs, we mapped VF simultaneously from two epicardial recording arrays, one on the RV and one on the LV. Each array contained 504 unipolar electrodes (in a 21 × 24 grid) spaced by 2 mm. We used specialized pattern analysis methods to compute quantitative descriptors of RV and LV activation patterns. Our data show that VF is more organized in the RV than the LV, containing fewer, larger wavefronts that follow fewer distinct pathways and are less likely to fragment or collide with other wavefronts. The incidence, size, and cycle length of reentrant circuits were similar in the two ventricles, but RV reentry persisted for more cycles. These results are not predicted by the differences in electrophysiologic properties between LV and RV that have been reported in mammalian hearts.\par
  {\em Conclusion:} The geometry of the ventricular wall, particularly wall thickness, is an important determinant of VF activation patterns.},

  abstract  = {{\em Background} -- Interaction between wave fronts in the right and left atrium may be important for maintenance of atrial fibrillation, but little is known about electrophysiological properties and preferential routes of transseptal conduction.\par
  {\em Methods and Results} -- Eighteen patients (age 44±12 years) without structural heart disease underwent right atrial electroanatomic mapping during pacing from the distal coronary sinus (CS) or the posterior left atrium. During distal CS pacing, 9 patients demonstrated a single transseptal breakthrough near the CS os, 1 patient in the high right atrium near the presumed insertion of Bachmann's bundle and 1 patient near the fossa ovalis. The mean activation time from stimulus to CS os was 48±15 ms compared with 86±15 ms to Bachmann's bundle insertion (P<0.01) and 59±23 ms to the fossa ovalis (P=NS and P<0.01, respectively). During left atrial pacing, the earliest right atrial activation was near Bachmann's bundle in 5 and near the fossa ovalis in 4 patients. The activation time from stimulus to CS os was 70±15 ms compared with 47±16 ms to Bachmann's bundle (P<0.01) and 59±25 ms to the fossa ovalis (P=NS). Whereas the total septal activation time was not significantly different during CS pacing compared with left atrial pacing (41±16 versus 33±17 ms), the total right atrial activation time was longer during CS pacing (117±49 versus 79±15 ms; P<0.05).\par
  {\em Conclusions} -- Three distinct sites of early right atrial activation may be demonstrated during left atrial pacing. These sites are in accord with anatomic muscle bundles and may have relevance for maintenance of atrial flutter or fibrillation.},

  abstract  = {The integral conservation equation for biological volume conductors with general geometry and arbitrary distribution of electrical conductivity is solved using a finite volume method.  An effective conductivity was defined for the boundaries between regions with abrupt change of the conductivity to allow the simultaneous solution of the entire domain although the derivatives are not continuous.  The geometrical singularities arising from the spherical topology of the coordinate system are removed using the conservation law.  The resulting finite volume solution method is efficient both in central processing unit (CPU) time and memory requirements, allowing the solution of the volume conductor equation using a large number of mesh points (of the order of 10$^5$) even on small workstations (like SGI Indigo).  It results in very accurate solutions, as several comparisons with analytical solutions of head models reveal.  The proposed finite volume method is an attractive alternative to the finite element and boundary element methods that are more common in bioelectric applications.},

The calculation takes into account the anisotropic and syncytial properties of the tissue, the presence of the interstitial space, the effect of the surrounding tissue bath, and the variation of the potential both along the strand length and across the strand cross section. The bidomain model is used to represent the electrical properties of the tissue, and the Ebihara-Johnson model is used to represent the properties of the active sodium channels. The calculated wave front is curved, with the action potential at the surface of the strand leading that at the center. The rate of rise of the action potential and the time constant of the action potential foot vary with depth into the tissue. The velocity of the wave front is nearly independent of strand radius for radii greater than 0.5 mm. The conduction velocity decreases as the volume fraction of the interstitial space decreases. In the limit of tightly packed cells, an action potential propagates quickly over the surface of the strand; the bulk of the tissue is then excited by a slow inward wave front initiated on the surface. This model does not predict an increase in conduction velocity when cells are tightly packed, a hypothesis that has been proposed previously to explain the fast conduction velocity in Purkinje fibers of some species.},

The bidomain model with unequal anisotropy ratios represented the tissue, and parallel leak and active sodium channels represented the membrane conductance. The speed of the wavefront was faster in the direction parallel to the myocardial fibers than in the direction perpendicular to them. However, for cathodal stimulation well above threshold, the wavefront originated farther from the cathode in the direction perpendicular to the myocardial fibers than in the direction parallel to them, consistent with observations of a dog-bone-shaped virtual cathode made by Wikswo {\em et al.}, Circ. Res. 68:513--530, 1991. The model showed that the virtual cathode size and shape were dependent upon both membrane and tissue conductivities. Increasing the peak Na conductance or reducing the transverse intracellular conductivity accentuated the dog-bone shape, while the opposite change caused the virtual cathode to become more elliptical, with the major axis of the ellipse transverse to the fiber direction. A cathodal stimulus created regions of hyperpolarization that slowed conduction of the wavefront propagating parallel to the fibers. An anodal stimulus evoked a wavefront with a complex shape; activation originated from two depolarized regions 1 to 2 mm from the stimulus site along the fiber direction. The threshold current strength (0.5 ms duration pulse) for a cathodal stimulus was 0.048 mA, and for an anodal stimulus was 0.67 mA. When the model was modified to simulate the effect of electropermeabilization, which may be present, when the transmembrane potential reaches very large values near the stimulating electrode, the authors' qualitative conclusions remained unchanged. ...},

They found that ``during longitudinal propagation there was initial slowing of $V_m$ [action potential] foot that resulted in deviations from a simple exponential... '' (p 1144). They attributed this behavior to the effects of capillaries on propagation. The purpose of this commentary is to show that the perfusing bath plays an important role in determining the time course of the action potential foot, even when the transmembrane potential is measured 150 µm below the tissue surface. Using numerical simulations based on the bidomain model, we find that the action potential foot for transverse propagation is nearly exponential ( $\tau_{foot}$=314 µs). For longitudinal propagation, the action potential foot is not exponential because of an initial slowing (best-fit$\tau_{foot}$=483 µs). We conclude that the perfusing bath must be taken into account when interpreting data showing differences in the shape of the action potential foot with propagation direction, even if the transmembrane potential is measured 150 µm below the tissue surface.},

Globally, the macroscopic velocity of propagation follows the behavior associated with propagation in a continuous tissue (except for high values of disk resistance). In addition, the computed spatial extracellular potential along the fiber is a smooth biphasic waveform and does not reflect the underlying discrete cellular structure of the tissue. Other results of the simulations demonstrate the discontinuous nature of propagation and the importance of the structure in arrhythmogenesis. $\dot{V}_{max}$ displays a biphasic behavior as a function of increasing intercalated disk resistance. An initial "paradoxical" increase in $\dot{V}_{max}$ (with a simultaneous decrease in conduction velocity) is followed by a decrease that leads to decremental propagation and conduction block. The time constant of the foot of the action potential ($\tau_{foot}$) increases monotonically with increasing intercalated disk resistance. An increase in the leakage current to extracellular space brings about a significant decrease in the action potential duration and a loss of the plateau. This major effect is accompanied by a relatively smaller decrease in conduction velocity. Collision of two activation wavefronts results in a significant (100%) increase in $\dot{V}_{max}$ and a very small (0.6%) decrease in $\tau_{foot}$.},

  abstract  = {The objective of the inverse problem in electrocardiography is to recover noninvasively regional information about intracardiac electrical events from electrical measurements on the body surface. The choice of epicardial potentials as the solution to the inverse problem is motivated by the availability of a unique epicardial potential solution for each body surface potential distribution, by the ability to verify experimentally the inverse-recovered epicardial potentials, by the proven relationship between epicardial potentials and the details of intracardiac regional events, and by the possibility of using the inverse solution as a supplement or possible replacement to clinical epicardial potential mapping prior to surgical intervention. Although, in principle, the epicardial potential distribution can be recovered from the body surface potential distribution, the inverse problem in terms of potentials is ill-posed, and naive attempts to reconstruct the epicardial potentials result in incorrect solutions which are highly oscillatory. Large deviations from the actual solution may result from inaccuracy of the data measurement, incomplete knowledge of the potential data over the entire torso, and inaccurate description of the inhomogeneous torso volume conductor. This review begins with a mathematical and qualitative description of the inverse problem in terms of epicardial potentials. The ill-posed nature of the problem is demonstrated using a theoretical boundary value problem. Effects of inaccuracies in the body surface potential data (stability estimates) are introduced, and a sensitivity analysis of geometrical and inhomogeneity parameters is presented using an analytical eccentric spheres model. Various computational methods for relating epicardial to body surface potentials, i.e., the computation of the forward transfer matrix, are described and compared. The need for regularization of the inverse recovery of epicardial potentials, resulting from the need to invert the ill-conditioned transfer matrix, is demonstrated. Several regularization techniques are compared in terms of their performance regarding noise in the data and inaccuracies in geometry and inhomogeneities. Finally, several existing, regularized inverse procedures that compute epicardial potentials from measured body surface potential data are introduced and compared. The review concludes with a section that points toward future directions for improving the quality of the inverse-reconstructed epicardial potentials. Future directions for the use of the inverse problem to obtain epicardial potential distributions noninvasively in both experimental animals and patients in a clinical setting.},

  abstract  = {The goal of noninvasive electrocardiographic imaging (ECGI) is to determine cardiac electrical activity by reconstructing maps of potentials, activation times (isochrones), and electrograms on the epicardial surface of the heart. This information can provide a detailed description of the underlying myocardial activity. Our earlier efforts at ECGI reconstruction were limited to analysis of epicardial activation (1,2) or to reconstruction of endocardial activation from a noncontact, multielectrode catheter probe (3-5). More recently, we explored the possibility that ECGI can be used to characterize intramural myocardial activation in the 3-dimensional myocardium. A discussion of this possibility is provided in this article, which summarizes previously published studies (6).},

  abstract  = {The last decade has generated extensive information on the genetic and molecular basis of disease. A major challenge remains the integration of this information into the physiological environment of the functioning cell and tissue. This article illustrates the use of computational biology in meeting this challenge in the context of cardiac excitation and arrhythmia. (1) {\bf Genetics to Cell Function:} Mutations that alter the kinetics of the cardiac sodium channel, \I{Na}, give rise to a congenital form of the long QT syndrome that can lead to sudden death. Using a computer modelof the cardiac cell, we simulated the effects of the mutations on the action potential, demonstrating its prolongation at slowrate and the develop-rate and the development of arrhythmogenic early afterdepolarizations due to reactivation of L-type Ca channels, \I{Ca(L)} [Clancy and Rudy, Nature (London) 400:566, 1999]. (2) {\bf Multicellular Tissue:} Slow conduction is an important property of propagation arrhythmias (reentry). Very slow conduction is supported by reduced intercellular coupling through gap junctions. Using a multicellular fiber model, we have shown that slow conduction is very stable and, in contrast to normal conduction which depends solely on \I{Na}, requires a major contribution from \I{Ca(L)} (Shaw and Rudy, Circ. Res. 81:727, 1997).},

We report here the design and validation of an array of MAP electrodes which records both depolarization and repolarization simultaneously at up to 16~epicardial sites in a square array on the heart {\em in vivo}.\par 
  The array consists of 16~sintered Ag-AgCl electrodes mounted in a common housing with individual suspensions allowing each electrode to exert a controlled pressure on the epicardial surface.  The electrodes are arranged in a square array, with each quadrant of four having an additional recessed sintered Ag-AgCl reference electrode at its center.  A saline-soaked sponge establishes ionic contact between the reference electrodes and the tissue.  The array was tested on six anesthetized open-chested pigs.\par 
  Simultaneous diagnostic-quality MAP recordings were obtained from up to 13 out of 16 ventricular sites.  Ventricular MAPs had amplitudes of 10--40 mV with uniform morphologies and stable base-lines for up to 30~min.  MAP duration at 90\% repolarization was measured and shown to vary as expected with cycle length during sustained pacing.  The relationship between MAP duration and effective refractory period was also confirmed.  The ability of the array to detect local differences in repolarization was tested in two ways.  Placement of the array straddling the atrioventricular (AV) junction yielded simultaneous atrial or ventricular recordings at corresponding sites during 1:1 and 2:1 AV conduction.  Localized ischemia via constriction of a coronary artery branch resulted in shortening of the repolarization phase at the ischemic, but not the nonischemic, sites.\par 
  In conclusion, these results indicate that the simultaneous multichannel MAP electrode array is a viable method for {\em in vivo} epicardial repolarization mapping.  The array has the potential to be expanded to increase the number of sites and spatial resolution.},

  abstract  = {Bidomain modeling of cardiac tissues provides important information about various complex cardiac activities. The cardiac tissue consists of interconnected cells which form fiber-like structures. The fibers are arranged in different orientations within discrete layers or sheets in the tissue, i.e., the fibers within the tissue are rotated. From a mathematical point of view, this rotation corresponds to a general anisotropy in the tissue's conductivity tensors. Since the rotation angle is different at each point, the anisotropic conductivities also vary spatially. Thus, the cardiac tissue should be viewed as an inhomogeneous anisotropic structure. In most of the previous bidomain studies, the fiber rotation has not been considered, i.e., the tissue has been modeled as a homogeneous orthotropic medium. Here, the authors describe a new finite-difference bidomain formulation which accounts for the fiber rotation in the cardiac tissue and hence allows a more realistic modeling of the cardiac tissue. The formulation has been implemented on the data-parallel CM-5 which provides the computational power and the memory required for solving large bidomain problems. Details of the numerical formulation are presented together with its validation by comparing numerical and analytical results. Some computational performance results are also shown. In addition, an application of this new formulation to provide activation patterns within a tissue slab with a realistic fiber rotation is demonstrated.},

  abstract  = {Abbreviation of the action potential duration and/or effective refractory period (ERP) is thought to decrease the cycle length of reentrant arrhythmias. Verapamil, however, paradoxically converts ventricular fibrillation (VF) to ventricular tachycardia (VT), despite reducing the ERP. This mechanism remains unclear. We hypothesize that the size and the dynamics of the core of rotating waves, in addition to the ERP, influence the arrhythmia manifestation (ie, VF or VT). The objectives of this study were (1) to demonstrate functional reentry as a mechanism of VF and VT in the isolated Langendorff-perfused rabbit heart in the absence of an electromechanical uncoupler and (2) to elucidate the mechanism of verapamil-induced conversion of VF to VT. We used high-resolution video imaging with a fluorescent dye, ECG, frequency and 2-dimensional phase analysis, and computer simulations. Activation patterns in 10 hearts were studied during control, verapamil perfusion (2x10$^{-6}$ mol/L), and washout. The dominant frequency of VF decreased from 16.2±0.7 to 13.5±0.6 Hz at 20 minutes of verapamil perfusion (P<0.007). Concomitantly, phase analysis revealed that wavefront fragmentation was reduced, as demonstrated by a 3-fold reduction in the density of phase singularities (PSs) on the ventricular epicardial surface (PS density: control, 1.04±0.12 PSs/cm$^2$; verapamil, 0.32±0.06 PSs/cm$^2$ [P=0.0008]). On washout, the dominant frequency and the PS density increased, and the arrhythmia reverted to VF. The core area of transiently appearing rotors significantly increased during verapamil perfusion (control, 4.5±0.6 mm$^2$; verapamil, 9.2±0.5 mm$^2$ [P=0.0002]). In computer simulations, blockade of slow inward current also caused an increase in the core size. Rotating waves underlie VF and VT in the isolated rabbit heart. Verapamil-induced VF-to-VT conversion is most likely due to a reduction in the frequency of rotors and a decrease in wavefront fragmentation that lessens fibrillatory propagation away from the rotor.},

  abstract  = {Reentrant ventricular tachycardia (VT) is the most common sustained arrhythmia leading to ventricular fibrillation (VF). However, despite more than a century of research, the mechanism(s) of the conversion from reentrant VT to VF have not been elucidated. Based on their different electrocardiographic appearance, reentrant VT and VF have traditionally been thought of as resulting from two widely different mechanisms. Whereas VT is seen as a rapid but well organized process whereby the excitation wave rotates about a single well-defined circuit, fibrillation has been described as turbulent cardiac electrical activity, resulting from the random and aperiodic propagation of multiple independent wavelets throughout the cardiac muscle. Recently, the application of concepts derived from the theory of non-linear dynamics to the problem of wave propagation in the heart and the advent of modern high-resolution mapping techniques, have led some investigators to view VT and VF in terms of a single mechanism, whereby the self-organization of electrical waves forms `rotors' that give rise to rapidly rotating spiral waves and results in either VT or VF, depending on the frequency of rotation and on the interaction of wave fronts with the cardiac muscle. As such, monomorphic VT is thought to result from a stationary rotor, whose frequency of rotation is within a range that allows 1:1 excitation of both ventricles. On the other hand, VF is thought to result from either a single rapidly drifting rotor, or a stationary rotor whose frequency of excitation is exceedingly high, thus resulting in multiple areas of intermittent block and giving rise to complex patterns of propagation with both deterministic and stochastic components. This article reviews the prevailing theories for the maintenance of VF, and discusses recently proposed mechanisms underlying transitions between VT and VF.},

Pixel-by-pixel spectral analysis of optical signals was carried out in video imaging experiments using a potentiometric dye in the Langendorff-perfused guinea pig heart. Dominant frequencies (peak with maximal power) were distributed throughout the ventricles in clearly demarcated domains. The fastest domain (25 to 32 Hz) was always on the anterior left ventricular (LV) wall and was shown to result from persistent rotor activity. Intermittent block and breakage of wavefronts at specific locations in the periphery of such rotors were responsible for the domain organization. Patch-clamping of ventricular myocytes from the LV and the right ventricle (RV) demonstrated an LV-to-RV drop in the amplitude of the outward component of the background rectifier current (\I{B}). Computer simulations suggested that rotor stability in LV resulted from relatively small rectification of \I{B} (presumably \I{K1}), whereas instability, termination, and wavebreaks in RV were a consequence of strong rectification. This study provides new evidence in the isolated guinea pig heart that a persistent high-frequency rotor in the LV maintains VF, and that spatially distributed gradients in \I{K1} density represent a robust ionic mechanism for rotor stabilization and wavefront fragmentation.},

With the use of both the Fenton-Karma and Luo-Rudy phase II membrane models, functional block is found to occur in tissue with a maximum gradient <45 ms/cm and depends on the spatial extent. In general, the narrower the extent the larger the magnitude needed for block. A simple relationship for predicting block is presented that only requires information about the conduction velocity (CV) restitution properties of the tissue and the APD gradients.

The use of a multielectrode catheter may shorten the procedure time and increase the accuracy of the procedure compared with single-electrode mapping techniques. This study was performed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a 32-bipolar-electrode mapping catheter in patients.\par
  {\em Methods and Results} -- The basket-shaped mapping catheter (BMC), integrated with a computerized mapping system, allowed on-line reconstruction of endocardial activation maps. Twenty patients with VT were studied before surgery (n=4) or radiofrequency catheter ablation (n=16). End-diastolic left ventricular (LV) volume was 280±120 mL, with an LV ejection fraction of 33±14%. The volume encompassed by the BMC was 164±27 mL (130 to 200 mL); the deployment time was 46±11 minutes. Endocardial activation time during sinus rhythm was 105±34 ms; 14±5 electrodes could be used to stimulate the heart. Cycle length of VT was 325±83 ms. Earliest endocardial activation was recorded 58±42 ms before the onset of the surface ECG. Complications were pericardial effusion (n=2) and transient cerebral disorientation (n=1).\par
  {\em Conclusions} -- Percutaneous multielectrode endocardial mapping in patients with VT is feasible and relatively safe. The use of this technique shortens the time patients have to endure VT.},

A perfused heart was suspended in a cylinder and surrounded with fluid of the conductivity of the lung. Computation of potential fields included conductivity and boundary effects and assumed a uniform double-layer source. Three instants (early, late, and mid QRS) during normal depolarization and one instant during a stimulated beat were studied. There was good qualitative agreement between recorded and predicted fields early and late in the QRS and during the stimulated beat, but there were quantitative differences. The cardiac generator was far stronger late in the QRS. In mid QRS, the agreement between recorded and predicted fields was very poor. To resolve questions raised in this study, potentials around a small volume of stimulated tissue were recorded and predicted. Recorded potentials were compared with potentials calculated (1) on the assumption that the cardiac generator is a uniform double layer and (2) on the assumption that all current flows along the long axes of the cardiac fibers. The recorded potentials compared most favorably with the second of these. These studies led to the opinion that the uniform double-layer assumption is inadequate for prediction of body surface potential fields from depolarization pathways. Other studies of the forward and inverse problem that assume a uniform double-layer source are considered to be successful and therefore disagree with this study's conclusion. It appears that the question needs further experimental study.},

  abstract  = {{\em Background} -- Catheter ablation of ventricular tachycardia is limited in part by difficulty in identifying suitable sites for ablation. A noncontact multielectrode array (MEA) has been developed that allows reconstruction of 3360 electrograms, using inverse-solution mathematics, that are superimposed onto a computer-simulated model of the endocardium. This study assesses the accuracy of timing and morphology of reconstructed unipolar electrograms compared with contact unipolar electrograms from the same endocardial site.\par
  {\em Methods and Results} -- The MEA was deployed in the left ventricles of 13 patients (end-diastolic diameters, 61.7±8.4 mm [mean±SD]). We recorded contact electrograms at 76 points equatorial and 32 points nonequatorial to the MEA during sinus rhythm using a catheter-locator signal to record direction and distance from the MEA. Morphology (cross-correlation) and timing of maximum -dV/dt of contact and reconstructed electrograms were compared at different distances from the MEA center to endocardium (M-E) and from the MEA equatorial plane. For equatorial data, the M-E was 32.12±12.12 mm. The timing of reconstructed with respect to contact electrograms was -1.94±7.12 ms for M-E <34 mm and -14.16±19.29 ms at M-E >34 mm (P<0.001). Cross-correlation of electrograms was 0.87±0.12 (95% CI, 0.84 to 0.91) and 0.76±0.18 (95% CI, 0.69 to 0.83) for M-E <34 mm and >34 mm, respectively. Nonequatorial points were 32.33±10.81 mm (range, 16.9 to 55.6 mm) from the MEA equatorial plane; electrogram timing difference was -8.97±15.75 ms and was unrelated to this distance from the equator.\par
  {\em Conclusions} -- This noncontact mapping system accurately reconstructs endocardial unipolar electrograms from the human left ventricle. At M-E distances >34 mm, timing accuracy of reconstruction decreases.},

  {\em Methods and Results} -- A catheter-mounted noncontact multielectrode array was used to reconstruct 3360 electrograms, superimposed onto a computer-simulated endocardial model. Of 24 patients studied, 20 had ischemic heart disease. Exit sites were demonstrated by the noncontact system in 80 (99%) of 81 VTs, with complete VT circuits traced in 17 (21%). In another 37 VTs, 36±30% (mean±SD) of the diastolic interval was identified. Thirty-eight VT morphologies were ablated with 154 RF energy applications. Successful ablation was achieved by 77% of RF applications to relevant diastolic activity identified by the system and was significantly more likely (P<0.0001) than by RF at the VT exit or remote from diastolic activation. Over a mean follow-up of 1.5 years, 14 patients (64%) have had no recurrence of VT, and only 2 target VTs (5.3%) have recurred. Five patients have had recurrence of other VTs.\par
  {\em Conclusions} -- This noncontact mapping system identified diastolic portions of the circuit in most VTs studied and can safely map and guide ablation of human VT.},

  abstract  = {{\em OBJECTIVES} This study was done to characterize human right atrial (RA) flutter (AFL) using noncontact mapping.\par
  {\em BACKGROUND} Atrial flutter has been mapped using sequential techniques, but complex anatomy makes simultaneous global RA mapping difficult.\par
  {\em METHODS} Noncontact mapping was used to map the RA of 13 patients with AFL (5 with previous attempts), 11 with counterclockwise and 2 with clockwise AFL. "Reconstructed" electrograms were validated against contact electrograms using cross-correlation. The Cartesian coordinates of points on a virtual endocardium were used to calculate the length and thus the conduction velocity (CV) of the AFL wave front within the tricuspid annulus-inferior vena cave isthmus (IS) and either side of the crista terminalis (CT).\par
  {\em RESULTS} When clearly seen, the AFL wave front split (n = 3) or turned in the region of the coronary sinus os (n = 6). Activation progressed toward the tricuspid annulus (TA) from the surrounding RA in 10 patients, suggesting that the leading edge of the reentry wave front is not always at the TA. The IS length and CV was 47.73 ± 24.40 mm (mean ± SD) and 0.74 ± 0.36 m/s. The CV was similar for the smooth and trabeculated RA (1.16 ± 0.48 m/s and 1.22 ± 0.65 m/s, respectively [p = 0.67]) and faster than the IS (p = 0.03 and P = 0.05 for smooth and trabeculated, respectively).\par
  {\em CONCLUSIONS} Noncontact mapping of AFL has been validated and has demonstrated that IS CV is significantly slower than either side of the CT.},

It enjoys several advantages over traditional histological approaches, including the ability to rapidly measure fiber organization in isolated, perfused, arrested hearts, thereby avoiding fixation and sectioning of artifacts. However, quantitative validation of this MRI method has been lacking. Here, fiber orientations estimated in the same locations in the same heart using both diffusion tensor MRI and histology are compared in a total of two perfused rabbit hearts. Fiber orientations were statistically similar for both methods and differed on average by 12° at any single location. This is similar to the 10° uncertainty in fiber orientation achieved with histology. In addition, imaging studies performed in a total of seven hearts support a level of organization beyond the myofiber, the recently described laminar organization of the ventricular myocardium.},

DTMRI-based estimates of fiber orientation in formaldehyde-fixed tissue are shown to agree closely with those measured using histological techniques, and evidence is presented suggesting that diffusion tensor tertiary eigenvectors may specify the orientation of ventricular laminar sheets. Using a semiautomated software tool called HEARTWORKS, a set of smooth contours approximating the epicardial and endocardial boundaries in each GRASS short-axis section are estimated. These contours are then interconnected to form a volumetric model of the cardiac ventricles. DTMRI-based estimates of fiber orientation are interpolated into these volumetric models, yielding reconstructions of cardiac ventricular fiber orientation based on at least an order of magnitude more sampling points than can be obtained using manual reconstruction methods.},

  abstract  = {{\em Objective:} To study the ionic mechanisms of electrophysiologic changes in cell excitability and action potential duration during the acute phase of myocardial ischemia.\par
  {\em Methods:} Using an ionic-based theoretical model of the cardiac ventricular cell, the dynamic LRd model, we have simulated the three major component conditions of acute ischemia (elevated [K]$_o$, acidosis and anoxia) at the level of individual ionic currents and ionic concentrations. The conditions were applied individually and in combination to identify ionic mechanisms responsible for reduced excitability at rest potentials, delayed recovery of excitability, and shortened action potential duration.\par
  {\em Results:} Increased extracellular potassium ([K]$_o$) had the major effect on cell excitability by depolarizing resting membrane potential (V$_{rest}$), causing reduction in sodium channel availability. Acidosis caused a [K]$_o$-independent reduction in maximum upstroke velocity, (d$V_m$/dt)$_{max}$. A transition from sodium-current dominated to calcium-current dominated upstroke occurred, and calcium current alone was able to sustain the upstroke, but only after sodium channels were almost completely (97%) inactivated. Acidic conditions prevented the transition to calcium dominated upstroke by acidic reduction of both sodium and calcium currents. Anoxia, simulated by lowering [ATP]$_i$ and activating the ATP-dependent potassium current, \I{K(ATP)}, was the only process that could decrease action potential duration by more than 50% and reproduce AP shape changes that are observed experimentally. Acidic or anoxic depression of the L-type calcium current could not reproduce the observed action potential shape changes and APD shortening. Delayed recovery of excitability, known as `post-repolarization refractoriness', was determined by the voltage-dependent kinetics of sodium channel recovery; V$_{rest}$ depolarization caused by elevated [K]$_o$ increased the time constant of (d$V_m$/dt)$_{max}$ recovery from \tau = 10.3 ms at [K]$_o$ = 4.5 mM to \tau = 81.4 ms at [K]$_o$=12 mM, reflecting major slowing of sodium-channel recovery. Anoxia and acidosis had little affect on \tau.\par
  {\em Conclusions:} The major conditions of acute ischemia, namely elevated [K]$_o$, acidosis and anoxia, applied at the ionic channel level are sufficient to simulate the major electrical changes associated with ischemia. Depression of membrane excitability and delayed recovery of excitability in the single, unloaded cell are caused by elevated [K]$_o$ with additional excitability depression by acidosis. Major changes in action potential duration and shape can only be accounted for by anoxia-dependent opening of \I{K(ATP)}.},

To overcome these problems, we developed an adaptive technique, referred to as the modified Karhunen-Loeve transform (MKLT), that identifies an individual characteristic (``core'') pattern of cardiac cycles and then tracks the changes in the pattern by projecting the signal onto characteristic eigenvectors. We hypothesized that disturbances in the core pattern, indicating progressive destabilization of cardiac rhythm, would predict the onset of spontaneous sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VTAs) better than previously reported methods. We analyzed serial ambulatory ECGs recorded in 57 patients at the time of VTA and non-VTA 24-hour periods. The disturbances in the pattern were found in 82% of the recordings before the onset of impending VTA, and their dimensionality, defined as the number of unstable orthogonal projections, increased gradually several hours before the onset. MKLT provided greater sensitivity and specificity (70% and 93%) compared with the best traditional method (68% and 67%, respectively). We present a theoretical analysis of MKLT and describe the effects of ectopy and slow changes in cardiac cycles on the disturbances in the pattern. We conclude that MKLT provides greater predictive accuracy than previously reported methods. The improvement is due to the use of individual patterns as a reference for tracking the changes. Because this approach is independent of the group reference values or the underlying clinical context, it should have substantial potential for predicting other forms of arrhythmic events in other populations.},

In attempting to quantitate these differences and assess their gradation across the ventricular wall, we encountered a subpopulation of cells in the deep subepicardial layers with electrophysiological characteristics different from those of either epicardium or endocardium. These cells, which we have termed M cells, display a spike-and-dome morphology typical of epicardium but a maximal rate of rise of the action potential upstroke that is considerably greater than that of either epicardium or endocardium. Using the restitution of the amplitude of phase 1 of the action potential as a marker for the reactivation of \I{to}, we showed M cells to possess a prominent 4-aminopyridine-sensitive \I{to} with a reactivation time course characterized by two components with fast and slow time constants. The rate dependence of action potential duration of M cells was considerably more accentuated than that of epicardium or endocardium and more akin to that of Purkinje fibers (not observed histologically in this region). Phase 4 depolarization was never observed in M cells, not even after exposure to catecholamines and/or low [\ionK]$_o$. In summary, our study presents evidence for the existence of a unique subpopulation of cells in the deep subepicardium of the canine left and right ventricles with electrophysiological features intermediate between those of conducting and myocardial cells. Although their function is unknown, M cells may facilitate conduction in epicardium and are likely to influence or mediate the manifestation of electrocardiographic J waves, T waves, U waves, and long QT intervals and contribute importantly to arrhythmogenesis.},

The anatomic location of each pacing site was computed using digitized biplane fluoroscopic images and plotted on standardized LV endocardial polar projections. A data base of characteristic AMI and IMI mean QRS integral maps was developed after visually selecting subgroups with nearly identical QRS integral morphology from the ectopic activation sequences produced at 110 sites in eight patients with AMI and at 66 sites in four patients with IMI. Intrasubgroup pattern uniformity and intersubgroup pattern variability were statistically verified. The endocardial pacing site locations belonging to each AMI and IMI subgroup were depicted as segments on the respective LV polar projections. In patients with AMI, a total of 18 typical mean QRS integral patterns were obtained, whereas 22 different mean total QRS integral patterns showing more substantial intersubgroup variation were acquired in patients with IMI. Posterolateral regions exhibited a relatively low electrocardiographic sensitivity (six AMI and five IMI patterns) as compared with anteroseptal regions (12 AMI and 17 IMI patterns). Total QRS integral patterns obtained at 24 sites in one patient with LMI were largely compatible with the IMI mean total QRS integral patterns, whereas the majority of total QRS integral patterns acquired at 21 sites in one patient with AMI/IMI corresponded with the AMI mean total QRS integral patterns. The results show that total body surface QRS integral maps generated during LV pacing in patients with prior myocardial infarction cluster by pattern and that each QRS integral pattern is related to a circumscribed endocardial segment of ectopic impulse formation. The relation between a given QRS integral pattern and the position and size of the corresponding paced segment is dependent on infarct location. The present infarct-specific data base of characteristic total body surface QRS integral patterns provides a clinical tool to obtain detailed electrocardiographic localization of ventricular arrhythmias in patients with previous myocardial infarction.},

  {\em METHODS AND RESULTS.} Simultaneous recordings of 62-lead body surface QRS integral maps and scalar 12-lead ECG tracings were obtained in 16 patients with prior myocardial infarction during a total of 26 distinct VT configurations and during subsequent left ventricular catheter pace mapping at 9 to 24 different endocardial sites.

The QRS integral map and the QRS complexes of the 12 standard leads of each VT morphology obtained in a particular patient were compared independently with the different paced QRS integral maps and paced QRS complexes of the 12-lead ECG generated in that same patient. The stimulus site locations of the best matching paced QRS integral map and paced QRS complexes of the 12-lead ECG were indicated on the polar projection and subsequently compared with the endocardial location of the corresponding site of VT origin identified during intraoperative (surgical ablation) or catheter activation sequence mapping (catheter ablation). The localization resolution of pace mapping was established separately for each electrocardiographic technique by computing the size of endocardial areas with similar morphological features of the QRS complex. Pace mapping advocated with body surface mapping or the 12-lead ECG enabled adequate reproduction of the VT QRS morphology in 24 of 26 VTs (92%) and 25 of 26 VTs (96%), respectively. Activation sequence mapping identified the site of origin in 12 of 26 previously observed VT configurations (46%). Ten and 11 VTs were localized by activation sequence mapping and pace mapping combined with body surface mapping or the 12-lead ECG, respectively. Pace mapping applied with body surface mapping identified the site of origin correctly (distance <= 2 cm) in 8 of 10 compared VTs (80%); an adjacent site (distance between 2 and 4 cm) or a disparate site (distance >= 4 cm) was identified in the remaining 2 of 10 VTs (20%). Pace mapping used with the 12-lead ECG localized the site of origin correctly in 2 of 11 VTs (18%); the site of origin was identified correctly next to an additional adjacent site in 5 of 11 VTs (55%); and an adjacent site or a disparate site was found in 1 of 11 VTs (9%) and 2 of 11 VTs (18%), respectively. The difference in localization accuracy of both electrocardiographic techniques was statistically significant (P = .02). The mean size of endocardial areas where a comparable QRS morphology was obtained during pace mapping was 6.0 +/- 4.5 cm$^2$ with the application of body surface mapping and 15.1 +/- 12.0 cm$^2$ with the use of the 12-lead ECG. \par
  {\em CONCLUSIONS.} These results demonstrate that application of the 62-lead instead of the 12-lead ECG during endocardial pace mapping enhances the localization resolution of this mapping technique and enables more precise identification of the site of arrhythmogenesis in the majority of compared postinfarction VT episodes.},

  abstract  = {Current mapping during radiofrequency (RF) catheter ablation of postinfarction ventricular tachycardia (VT) is based primarily on the use of single-site mapping techniques. Although such techniques are highly suitable for distinguishing the ultimate site where RF energy is delivered by enabling detailed localization of the exit site or critical component of the VT reentrant circuit, they are time-consuming and inefficient for initial rapid identification of the arrhythmogenic target area. This study features the design and preliminary clinical application of a new noninvasive method that is aimed at speeding up the initial phase of the VT mapping procedure. This method is based on the use of an atlas of 62-lead body surface QRS integral map patterns that was previously developed using left ventricular pace mapping in patients with remote anterior or inferior myocardial infarction. The atlas contains 18 and 22 different paced QRS integral map patterns obtained in patients with previous anterior or inferior myocardial infarction, respectively. Each specific QRS pattern in the atlas provides a unique infarct-specific spatial electrocardiographic representation of the onset of ectopic ventricular activation in a circumscribed endocardial segment of the left ventricle. Localization of the segment of VT origin is obtained by visually or mathematically comparing the QRS integral map recorded during VT with one of the two sets of paced QRS integral maps contained within the atlas with the purpose of selecting the best matching paced QRS integral map pattern. During RF catheter ablation of postinfarction VT, body surface QRS integral mapping offers an efficient clinical tool that can be used as a first-step localization procedure that may guide subsequent catheter pace mapping or activation mapping quickly to the arrhythmogenic target area.},

  abstract  = {{\em Background}--The morphology and polarity of the P wave on 12-lead ECG are of limited clinical value in localizing ectopic atrial rhythms. It was the aim of this study to assess the spatial resolution of body surface P-wave integral mapping in identifying the site of origin of ectopic right atrial (RA) impulse formation in patients without structural atrial disease.\par
  {\em Methods and Results}--Sixty-two-lead ECG recordings were obtained during RA pacing at 86 distinct endocardial sites in nine patients with normal biatrial anatomy. After P-wave integral maps were generated for each paced activation sequence, 17 groups with nearly identical map features were visually selected, and a mean P-wave integral map was computed for each group. Supportive statistical analysis to corroborate qualitative group selection was performed by assessment of (1) intragroup pattern uniformity by use of jackknife correlation coefficient analysis of the integral maps contained in each group and (2) intergroup pattern variability by use of the calculation of cross correlations between the 17 mean integral maps. The spatial resolution of paced P-wave body surface mapping in the right atrium was obtained by estimating the area size of endocardial segments with nearly identical P-wave integral maps by use of a biplane fluoroscopic method to compute the three-dimensional position of each pacing site. The latter approach yielded a mean endocardial segment size of 3.5±2.9 cm$^2$ (range, 0.79 to 10.75 cm$^2$).\par
  {\em Conclusions}--Use of the P-wave morphology on the 62-lead surface ECG in patients with normal biatrial anatomy allows separation of the origin of ectopic RA impulse formation into one of 17 different endocardial segments with an approximated area size of 3.5 cm$^2$. This database of paced P-wave integral maps provides a versatile clinical tool to perform detailed noninvasive localization of right-sided atrial tachycardia before radiofrequency catheter ablation.},

The tissue is represented as a homogeneous bidomain with unequal anisotropy ratios. Two case studies are presented in this article: tissue that can electroporate at high levels of transmembrane potential, and model tissue that does not support electroporation. In both cases, the spiral wave is initiated via cross-field stimulation of the bidomain sheet. The extracellular defibrillation shock is delivered via two small electrodes located at opposite tissue boundaries. Modifications in the active membrane kinetics enable the delivery of high-strength defibrillation shocks. Numerical solutions are obtained using an efficient semi-implicit predictor-corrector scheme that allows one to execute the simulations within reasonable time. The simulation results demonstrate that anode and/or cathode break excitations contribute significantly to the activity during and after the shock. For a successful defibrillation shock, the virtual electrodes and the break excitations restrict the spiral wave and render the tissue refractory so it cannot further maintain the reentry. The results also indicate that electroporation alters the anode/cathode break phenomena, the major impact being on the timing of the cathode-break excitations. Thus, electroporation results in different patterns of transmembrane potential distribution after the shock. This difference in patterns may or may not result in change of the outcome of the shock.},

  {\em METHODS AND RESULTS:} The research uses a model of the defibrillation process that represents a sheet of myocardium as a bidomain. The tissue consists of nonuniformly curved fibers in which spiral wave reentry is initiated. Monophasic defibrillation shocks are delivered via two line electrodes that occupy opposite tissue boundaries. In some simulation experiments, the polarity of the shock is reversed. Electrical activity in the sheet is compared for failed and successful shocks under controlled conditions. The maps of transmembrane potential and activation times calculated during and after the shock demonstrate that weak shocks fail to terminate the reentrant activity via two major mechanisms. As compared with strong shocks, weak shocks result in (1) smaller extension of refractoriness in the areas depolarized by the shock, and (2) slower or incomplete activation of the excitable gap created by deexcitation of the negatively polarized areas. In its turn, mechanism 2 is associated with one or more of the following events: (a) lack of some break excitations, (b) latency in the occurrence of the break excitations, and (c) slower propagation through deexcited areas. Reversal of shock polarity results in a change of the extent of the regions of deexcitation, and thus, in a change in defibrillation threshold.\par
  {\em CONCLUSION:} The results of this study indicate the paramount importance of shock-induced deexcitation in both defibrillation and postshock arrhythmogenesis.},

  abstract  = {Realistic simulations of the effects of strong shocks on cardiac muscle require solving the bidomain model, a continuum representation of cardiac tissue by a system of two reaction-diffusion equations. For two- and three-dimensional problems, the computations tend to take a prohibitively long time. This study develops a computationally efficient and accurate approximation of the bidomain model: a ``reduced bidomain'' model. The approximation is based on the fact that during a strong shock, the extracellular field in the muscle changes only slightly and, therefore, can be approximated by an activating function, following the concept introduced by Rattay (Rattay, F. Analysis of models for external stimulation of axons. {\em IEEE Trans. Biomed. Eng.} 33:974-977, 1986). The activating function used here is time-dependent and is computed using an iterative algorithm. The results show that in two spatial dimensions, the ``reduced bidomain'' model, as implemented in this study, cuts the computational cost by two orders of magnitude while preserving most properties of the ``full bidomain'' model. It faithfully represents the spatial pattern and the temporal development of the muscle polarization. Consequently, relative errors in the ``defibrillation'' threshold, the strength of the weakest shock that terminates all electrical activity within 100 ms, are below 10%.},

To achieve this, precise and reproducible catheter manipulation is mandatory. The aim of this study was (1) to assess the accuracy of a new nonfluoroscopic mapping system in humans and (2) to report the first result of endocardial activation mapping with this system during sinus rhythm and several types of supraventricular and ventricular tachycardias.\par
  {\em Methods and Results} -- Fifteen patients were studied. Accuracy measurements were performed in 5 of them (patients 5, 6, 7, 8, and 14). The distances between two subsequent catheter positions in the inferior caval vein as determined by the nonfluoroscopic mapping system were compared with measurements made with calipers by four independent investigators using identification marks on the catheter shaft. The difference between these two methods was 0.95±0.8 mm. In 15 patients, activation of the right atrium and/or the right or left ventricle was recorded during sinus rhythm. Three-dimensional activation maps were constructed in patients with atrial and ventricular tachycardias and Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.\par
  {\em Conclusions} -- With this new nonfluoroscopic mapping technique, accurate positioning of the catheter tip is possible. A three-dimensional activation map can be reconstructed during sinus rhythm and during supraventricular and ventricular tachycardias of different compartments of the heart.},

This model revealed that spatial dispersion of refractoriness is a sufficient condition to produce self-sustained reentry even in the absence of unidirectional block, inhomogeneity in local conduction velocities, or the presence of ectopic pacemakers. The model displayed a wide variety of rhythm disturbances qualitatively similar to clinically familiar cardiac dysrhythmias. Electrical stability of the model was determined as a function of the model parameters including ventricular stimulation rate, conduction velocity, and mean refractory period as well as standard deviation of refractory periods. We conclude that spatial dispersion of refractoriness is a sufficient condition to initiate reentrant dysrhythmias but that other physiologic variables such as ventricular rate and conduction velocity strongly influence the dysrhythmogenic effect of spatial dispersion of refractoriness.},

Epicardial potential distributions were used because they provide a comprehensive picture of total cardiac electrical activity for relating heart and body surface events during both ventricular activation and repolarization. When the epicardial potential gradients existed over a distance greater than that to the recording points on the body surface, e.g., as occurred during the overlap of terminal ventricular activation and early repolarization, the epicardial events were mirrored well on the anterior chest surface. However, when the recording points were at a distance greater than that over which the epicardial potential gradients existed, the details of the epicardial events disappeared and their effect was to produce distinct changes in the low-level potentials over broad distant areas. The major manifestations on the body surface of selective epicardial events frequently were changes in the distant low-level potential areas while there was no change in the pattern near the maximum or minimum. The ST-T wave body surface distributions were as useful as the QRS patterns for localizing the ventricular ectopic foci presented. A direct experimental basis is provided for explaining T wave notches which occurred during normal and ectopic beats and resembled U waves. It should be possible to achieve as precise an understanding of ST-T waves on the basis of epicardial potential distributions as has thus far been achieved for QRS on the basis of isochrones.},

In this article we describe the development of the application of the theory of continuous media to propagation in cardiac muscle and review some of the successes achieved with this theory. New evidence is cited that propagation in cardiac muscle often displays a discontinuous nature. We consider the hypothesis that this previously unrecognized aspect of propagation can be explained by discontinuities in axial resistance related to known structural complexities of cardiac muscle. A major implication is that the combination of discontinuities of effective axial resistivity at several size levels can produce a wide variety of complex abnormalities of propagation, including most currently known cardiac conduction disturbances that have been considered to require spatial nonuniformity of membrane properties.},

The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate, however, that a simplified cable model based on directional differences in the effective membrane capacitance predicts in detail the experimentally measured directionally dependent behavior of the upstroke in response to modification of the sodium conductance. Quinidine and lidocaine produced greater relative decreases in $\dot{V}_{max}$ and conduction velocity with longitudinal propagation than with transverse propagation, as predicted on the basis that the shape differences should produce an anisotropic distribution in the membrane uptake of sodium channel binding drugs. The simulation predictions of the effects of positive shifts of the take-off potential due to premature action potentials were also confirmed experimentally: there was a greater relative decrease in conduction velocity, $\dot{V}_{max}$, and $V_{amp}$ with a greater increase in $\tau_{foot}$ during longitudinal propagation than with transverse propagation. The major anisotropic differences in shape occurred when the take-off potential approached the least negative value that produced a propagated response. The extensive experimental verification of the results of a simplified model based on directional differences of effective membrane capacitance, combined with directional differences in effective axial resistivity, provides an initial quantitative basis for the anisotropic behavior of propagating depolarization in response to modification of the sodium conductance in cardiac muscle.},

Measurement of multidimensional refractory periods demonstrated an anisotropic distribution within large bundles with the longest refractory periods in the medial upper crista terminalis (sinus node area), a distribution similar to that of action potential durations. Also, discontinuities of repolarization were found at muscle bundle junctions. Early premature impulses originating in the sinus node area propagated throughout the right atrial preparations without conduction disturbances or reentry. Conversely, early premature impulses that originated at sites distal to the sinus node area resulted in localized conduction block at multiple sites, which frequently produced complex conduction changes and reentry. The critical nature of the site of origin of a premature impulse in initiating reentry was related to locations where the steepest repolarization gradients occurred: within anisotropic bundles in the direction of highest axial resistance (across fibers) and at muscle bundle junctions that represented localized discontinuities of axial resistance. The multiple conduction abnormalities at localized sites interacted to produce different types of reentry at a larger size scale (25 mm^2 to several cm^2). In each case, neither repolarization inhomogeneities (leading circle concept) nor anisotropic discontinuous propagation was the only ``mechanism'' involved. That is, reentry at a macroscopic size scale occurred as a result of a combined repolarization-anisotropic discontinuous propagation mechanism.},

  abstract  = {Recent studies of isolated cardiac myocytes have generated the need for detailed information about regional electrophysiological differences in the atrium. We measured the spatial distribution of action potentials in adult and newborn canine right atria. Multiple regional differences in action potential shape and duration were found. The multiple regional differences produced an overall simple pattern: the longest action potentials occurred in the area of the sinus node, and the action potential duration decreased with increasing distance from the sinus node area. To account for the overall pattern, we tested factors considered important in causing atrial action potential shape differences (e.g., electronic interactions). None of the factors tested accounted for the regional differences. We then found regional differences in the responses to pauses, which suggested that differences in the properties of individual cells accounted for the regional repolarization differences. If so, genetic regulation of the regional differences may produce the overall pattern on a developmental basis. Experiments in newborn atria showed that only in the upper crista was the spatial pattern similar to that of the adult; there was little variability in action potential shape and duration in the other areas. As a further test for associated regional differences in cell properties, we examined for differences in the isoform expression of troponin T (TnT$_1$, TnT$_2$, TnT$_3$, and TnT$_4$), a protein important in excitation-contraction coupling. In adults, the greatest proportion of TnT$_1$ occurred in the area of the sinus node, and its proportion decreased with increasing distance from the sinus node area in association with a relative increase in the proportion of TnT$_2$. In newborn atria the relative amount of TnT$_1$ was greatest in the upper crista (similar to adult), but little difference was found in the distribution of the isoforms in the other regions. The correspondence between the regional differences in repolarization and in the expression of the troponin T isoforms in adult and newborn atria suggests that 1) cellular ionic mechanisms vary regionally to coordinate differences in action potential configuration with differences in cell properties that regulate contractility and 2) genetic expression of the systems that regulate repolarization and mechanical cellular properties are under similar developmental and regional control.},

  abstract  = {It has become of fundamental importance to understand variations in the shape of the upstroke of the action potential in order to identify structural loading effects. One component of this goal is a detailed experimental analysis of the time course of the foot of the cardiac action potential ($V_m$ foot) during propagation in different directions in anisotropic cardiac muscle. To this end, we performed phase-plane analysis of transmembrane action potentials during anisotropic propagation in adult working myocardium. The results showed that during longitudinal propagation there was initial slowing of $V_m$ foot that resulted in deviations from a simple exponential; corollary changes occurred at numerous sites during transverse propagation. We hypothesized that the effect on Vm foot observed in the experimental data was created by the microscopic structure, especially the capillaries. This hypothesis predicts that the phase-plane trajectory of $V_m$ foot will deviate from linearity in the presence of a high density of capillaries, and that a linear trajectory will occur in the absence of capillaries. Comparison of the results of Fast and Kléber ({\em Circ Res.} 1993;73:914-925) in a monolayer of neonatal cardiac myocytes, which is devoid of capillaries, and our results in newborn ventricular muscle, which is rich in capillaries, showed drastic differences in $V_m$ foot as predicted. Because this comparison provided experimental support for the capillary hypothesis, we explored the underlying biophysical mechanisms due to interstitial electrical field effects, using a ``2-domain'' model of myocytes and capillaries separated by interstitial space. The model results show that a propagating interstitial electrical field induces an inward capacitive current in the inactive capillaries that causes a feedback effect on the active membrane (source) that slows the initial rise of its action potential. The results show unexpected mechanisms related to extracellular structural loading that may play a role in selected conduction disturbances, such as in a reperfused ischemic region surrounded by normal myocardium.},

  abstract  = {The increased incidence of arrhythmias in structural heart disease is accompanied by remodeling of the cellular distribution of gap junctions to a diffuse pattern like that of neonatal cardiomyocytes. Accordingly, it has become important to know how remodeling of gap junctions due to normal growth hypertrophy alters anisotropic propagation at a cellular level ( $\dot{V}_{max}$) in relation to conduction velocities measured at a macroscopic level. To this end, morphological studies of gap junctions (connexin43) and in vitro electrical measurements were performed in neonatal and adult canine ventricular muscle. When cells enlarged, gap junctions shifted from the sides to the ends of ventricular myocytes. Electrically, normal growth produced different patterns of change at a macroscopic and microscopic level. Although the longitudinal and transverse conduction velocities were greater in adult than neonatal muscle, the anisotropic velocity ratios were the same. In the neonate, mean $\dot{V}_{max}$ was not different during longitudinal (LP) and transverse (TP) propagation. However, growth hypertrophy produced a selective increase in mean TP $\dot{V}_{max}$ (P<0.001), with no significant change in mean LP $\dot{V}_{max}$. Two-dimensional neonatal and adult cellular computational models show that the observed increases in cell size and changes in the distribution of gap junctions are sufficient to account for the experimental results. Unexpectedly, the results show that cellular scaling (cell size) is as important (or more so) as changes in gap junction distribution in determining TP properties. As the cells enlarged, both mean TP $\dot{V}_{max}$ and lateral cell-to-cell delay increased. $\dot{V}_{max}$ increased because increases in cell-to-cell delay reduced the electric current flowing downstream up to the time of $\dot{V}_{max}$, thus enhancing $\dot{V}_{max}$. The results suggest that in pathological substrates that are arrhythmogenic, maintaining cell size during remodeling of gap junctions is important in sustaining a maximum rate of depolarization.},

On the basis of evidence we present in this article, we argue that the anisotropic waveform variations discussed here are explained primarily by the associated variations in different microstructural components of myocardial architecture rather than by the effects of the perfusing bath. The results suggest that different components of myocardial architecture have preferential effects on $\dot{V}_{max}$ and on the shape of the foot of the transmembrane action potential ($V_m$ foot). Resistive discontinuities primarily affect $\dot{V}_{max}$, and an additional capacitive component in the local circuit due to the capillaries in interstitial space primarily affects $V_m$ foot. Resistive discontinuities also have an important influence on cardiac conduction. These discontinuities include spatial variations in the size of interstitial space (interstitial resistive discontinuities) and the role of cellular scaling (effects of cell size) when changes occur in the cellular and multicellular distribution of gap junctions during remodeling of normal mature myocardium to proarrhythmic structural substrates.},

Evaluation of these signals requires either very sophisticated recording techniques for single-beat analysis or signal averaging. Signal averaging, however, might disregard information about risk stratification. Therefore, the authors developed the Single-Beat Spectral Variance (SBSV) based on two-dimensional (2-D) Fourier transform of 80 ms segments of 128 consecutive beats. This approach depicts the beat-to-beat variability of the frequency contents of these ECG segments. An index function enables an objective detection of late potentials. The authors investigated 35 patients after myocardial infarction and sustained ventricular tachycardia (Group 1), 50 patients after myocardial infarction without ventricular arrhythmias (Group 2) and ten healthy volunteers, SBSV classified 29 of 35 patients (83%) of Group 1 as pathologic, 14 of these 29 patients (48%) exclusively on the basis of marked Wenckebach-like conduction pattern. In Group 2, only five of 50 patients showed abnormal SBSV. In Group 3, the authors found no pathologic result. Thus, SBSV is a promising new method to investigate late potentials inpatients after myocardial infarction, SBSV-contains not only the results of frequency analysis after signal averaging, but also evaluates variable ECG components.},

Theory predicts that the intrinsic deflection--the time of the maximum negative slope of the unipolar electrogram QRS complex--corresponds to the time of maximum positive slope of action potential depolarization. Similarly, the time of the maximum positive slope of the unipolar electrogram T wave corresponds to the time of maximum negative slope of action potential repolarization. This study showed that the difference between the unipolar electrogram activation time and the action potential activation time and the difference between the unipolar electrogram recovery time and the action potential recovery time were small during ideal conditions of uniform propagation in a long cable. Nonideal conditions, however, were associated with activation time differences in excess of 1.8 msec and recovery time differences in excess of 30 msec (243 msec in certain conditions). Nonideal conditions that had a major influence were changes in activation sequence, propagation in a short cable, and propagation through regions of nonuniform coupling resistance and/or nonuniform membrane properties. Nonideal conditions that had a smaller influence were variations in distance from the measurement site to the simulated tissue surface, nonzero reference potentials, and the addition of distant events. Recovery time differences were more sensitive to the nonideal conditions than were activation time differences, and both depended on the action potential shape. When distant events significantly contributed to the unipolar electrogram waveform, the time differences when bipolar electrograms were used were less than those when unipolar electrograms were used; however, under other conditions, the time differences were comparable. Results showed that activation times and especially recovery times measured from electrograms can be greatly affected by conditions independent of changes in the underlying action potential waveforms.},

Peripheral pressure is separated into its forward and backward components, and these components are then shifted with a delay time, which is the ratio of wave speed and distance, and added again to reconstruct aortic pressure. We tested the method on a distributed model of the human systemic arterial tree. From carotid and brachial artery pressure and velocity, aortic systolic and diastolic pressure could be predicted within 0.3 and 0.1 mmHg and 0.4 and 1.0 mmHg, respectively. The central aortic pressure wave shape was also predicted accurately from carotid and brachial pressure and velocity (root mean square error: 1.07 and 1.56 mmHg, respectively). The pressure transfer function depends on the reflection coefficient at the site of peripheral measurement and the delay time. A 50% decrease in arterial compliance had a considerable effect on reconstructed pressure when the control transfer function was used. A 70% decrease in arm resistance did not affect the reconstructed pressure. The transfer function thus depends on wave speed but has little dependence on vasoactive state. We conclude that central aortic pressure and the transfer function can be derived from peripheral pressure and velocity.},

  {\bf BACKGROUND} Mapping VT in the electrophysiology laboratory conventionally is achieved by sequentially positioning an electrode catheter at multiple endocardial sites.\par
  {\bf METHODS} Fifteen patients with VT underwent 18 electrophysiology procedures using the noncontact, computerized mapping system. A 9F 64 electrode balloon catheter and a conventional 7F electrode catheter for mapping and ablation were positioned in the LV using a retrograde aortic approach. Using a boundary element inverse solution, 3,360 virtual endocardial electrograms were computed and used to derive isopotential maps. An incorporated locator system was used in conjunction with or instead of fluoroscopy to position the conventional electrode catheter.\par
  {\bf RESULTS} A total of 21 VTs, 12 of which were hemodynamically-tolerated and 9 of which were not, were mapped. Isolated diastolic potentials, presystolic areas, zones of slow conduction and exit sites during VT were identified using virtual electrograms and isopotential maps. Among 19 targeted VTs, radiofrequency ablation guided by the computerized mapping system and the locator signal was successful in 15.\par

The method incorporated geometric and anatomical features of the left and right ventricles into the analysis. Optical images of propagation were obtained using the voltage-sensitive dye DI-4-ANEPPS, and a high-speed digital camera. Activation maps were extracted from these images and interpolated onto a three-dimensional finite-element model of epicardial geometry and fiber structure. Activation time was expressed as a function of local parametric coordinates, and a conduction velocity vector field was computed from the gradient of the scalar field. Activation times measured using bipolar electrodes did not differ significantly from times measured using the optical mapping technique. The method was able to detect a 34% decrease in average fiber velocity and a 28% decrease in average cross-fiber velocity following the addition of 0.5 mM heptanol into the perfusate. The combination of optical mapping with a three-dimensional geometric model of the ventricles provides a new tool to quantify wave-front propagation relative to anatomy at a relatively high spatial resolution.},

We have developed an image processing method to enhance the quality of optical signals recorded using a CCD camera. The method is based on the observation that within a small neighborhood of adjacent pixels, the morphology of the optical action potential varies little except for a phase shift in time resulting from the propagation of the wavefront. The method uses a phase-correlation technique to first correct for this time shift before spatially filtering with a 5×5 Gaussian convolution kernel (\sigma = 1.179). A length 5 median filter is then applied to further reduce noise by filtering in the temporal domain. The image-processing scheme allows for more accurate extraction of maps of electrical activation, repolarization, and action potential duration.},

  abstract  = {It long has been known that mechanical forces play a role in the development of the cardiovascular system, but only recently have biomechanical engineers begun to explore this field. This paper reviews some of this work. First, an overview of the relevant biology is discussed. Next, a mechanical theory is presented that can be used to model developmental processes. The theory includes the effects of finite volumetric growth and active contractile forces. Finally, applications of this and other theories to problems of cardiovascular development are discussed, and some future directions are suggested. The intent is to stimulate further interest among engineers in this important area of research.},

  abstract  = {{\em BACKGROUND:} Understanding the relations between the architecture of myocardial fibers, the spread of excitation, and the associated ECG signals is necessary for addressing the forward problem of electrocardiography, that is, predicting intracardiac and extracardiac ECGs from known intracardiac activity. So far, these relations have been studied experimentally only in small myocardial areas. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that potential distributions measured over extensive epicardial regions during paced beats reflect the direction of superficial and intramural fibers through which excitation is spreading in both the initial and later stages of ventricular excitation. We also tried to establish whether the features of the epicardial potential distribution that correlate with fiber direction vary as a function of pacing site, intramural pacing depth, and time elapsed after the stimulus. An additional purpose was to compare measured epicardial potentials with recently published numerical simulations depicting the three-dimensional spread of excitation in the heart muscle and the associated potential fields.\par
  {\em METHODS AND RESULTS:} The hearts of 18 mongrel dogs were exposed and 182 to 744 unipolar electrograms were recorded from epicardial electrode arrays (2.3 x 3.0 to 6.5 x 6.5 cm). Hearts were paced at various intramural depths through an intramural needle. The overall number of pacing sites in 18 dogs was 241. Epicardial potential distributions, electrographic waveforms, and excitation time maps were displayed, and fiber directions in the ventricular wall underlying the electrodes were determined histologically. During the early stages of ventricular excitation, the position of the epicardial maxima and minima revealed the orientation of myocardial fibers near the pacing site in all cases of epicardial and intramural pacing and in 60% of cases of endocardial or subendocardial pacing. During later stages of propagation, the rotation and expansion of the positive areas correlated with the helical spread of excitation through intramurally rotating fibers. Marked asymmetry of potential patterns probably reflected epicardial- endocardial obliqueness of intramural fibers. Multiple maxima appeared in the expanding positive areas.\par
  {\em CONCLUSIONS:} For 93% of pacing sites, results verified our hypothesis that epicardial potential patterns elicited by ventricular pacing reflect the direction of fibers through which excitation is spreading during both the initial and later stages of propagation. Epicardial potential distributions provided information on the site of origin and subsequent helical spread of excitation in an epicardial-endocardial, endocardial-epicardial, or double direction. Results were in agreement with previously published numerical simulations except for the asymmetry and fragmentation of the positive areas.},

Exercise-induced myocardial ischaemia was detected by heart rate adjustment of change in magnetic field map orientation.  In addition to the ST segment, the T wave in the MCG was also found to provide information related to myocardial ischaemia.  The method of analysis efficiently utilizes the spatial and temporal properties of multichannel MCG mapping, providing a new tool for detecting and quantifying fast phenomena during interventional MCG studies.

  abstract  = {In 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG), detection of myocardial ischemia is based on ST-segment changes in exercise testing. Magnetocardiography (MCG) is a complementary method to the ECG for a noninvasive study of the electric activity of the heart. In the MCG, ST-segment changes due to stress have also been found in healthy subjects. To further study the normal response to exercise, we performed MCG mappings in 12 healthy volunteers during supine bicycle ergometry. We also recorded body surface potential mappings (BSPM) with 123 channels using the same protocol. In this paper we compare, for the first time, multichannel MCG recorded in bicycle exercise testing with BSPM over the whole thorax in middle-aged healthy subjects. We quantified changes induced by the exercise in the MCG and BSPM with parameters based on signal amplitude, and correlation between signal distributions at rest and after exercise. At the ST-segment and T-wave apex, the exercise induced a magnetic field component outward the precordium and the minimum value of the MCG signal over the mapped area was found to be amplified. The response to exercise was smaller in the BSPM than in the MCG. A negative component in the MCG signal at the repolarization period of the cardiac cycle should be considered as a normal response to exercise. Therefore, maximum ST-segment depression over the mapped area in the MCG may not be an eligible parameter when evaluating the presence of ischemia.},

  abstract  = {{\em Introduction:} Little information is available on the relationship between the mode of induction of ventricular fibrillation (VF) to VF characteristics.\par
  {\em Methods and Results:} VF was induced from the anterior left ventricle by programmed electrical stimulation, burst pacing, alternating current (AC), high current S2 at a site remote from S1, T wave shock, and intersecting wavefronts in seven normal dogs and seven dogs with chronic myocardial infarction. Using two electrode arrays, 112 electrograms were recorded from the anterior and lateral wall. Cycle lengths were analyzed and activation vectors were created by summing orthogonally recorded bipolar electrograms. The magnitude of the vector loops was integrated over time to produce an "ensemble vector" index (EVI) whose magnitude is high when beat-to-beat activation direction is consistent and low when activation direction is variable. T wave shock-induced VF had a significantly longer cycle length 1 to 5 seconds after VF onset than other modes of induction (P < 0.05). The frequency-corrected EVI was significantly larger for AC current and T wave shock-induced VF as opposed to all other modes of VF induction in early VF (P < 0.0001). After 10 seconds of VF, these differences persisted only on the anterior wall.\par
  {\em Conclusion:} VF induced in animals by T wave shock and AC current had different characteristics than VF induced by other methods. These findings may have implications for our understanding of VF pathophysiology.},

One of the main reasons for these problems is that, while the data sets are always bounded, the resulting algebraic curves or surfaces are, in most cases, unbounded. In this paper, the authors propose to constrain the polynomials to a family with bounded zero sets, and use only members of this family in the fitting process. For every even number d the authors introduce a new parameterized family of polynomials of degree d whose level sets are always bounded, in particular, its zero sets. This family has the same number of degrees of freedom as a general polynomial of the same degree. Three methods for fitting members of this polynomial family to measured data points are introduced. Experimental results of fitting curves to sets of points in $R_2$ and surfaces to sets of points in $R_3$ are presented.},

The source of this ST elevation is thought to be local inflammatory changes in the epicardium underlying the inflamed pericardium. The current from this area of ST elevation must return to some unaffected region of the heart and this should be associated with a region of ST depression. This current path from the external epicardial surface has been postulated to flow back into the endocardium through the great vessels and atria. To test this hypothesis, 18 patients with pericarditis were studied by body surface potential mapping and inverse epicardial potential distributions were computed. The resultant maps were compared to those of normal people and patients with acute anterior infraction. Epicardial maps from patients with pericarditis showed a region of current flow into the heart over the great vessels and atria in all 18 patients. This pattern was not seen in normal patients or infarction patients and was consistent with the mechanism resulting in ST elevation in pericarditis being one of current flowing from the epicardium out into the thorax and back into the heart through the great vessels and atria.},

The model's six global deformational degrees of freedom capture gross shape features from visual data and provide salient part descriptors for efficient indexing into a database of stored models. The local deformation parameters reconstruct the details of complex shapes that the global abstraction misses. The equations of motion which govern the behavior of deformable superquadrics make them responsive to externally applied forces. We fit models to visual data by transforming the data into forces and simulating the equations of motion through time to adjust the translational, rotational, and deformational degrees of freedom of the models.

Besides affecting the activation isochrones, this anisotropy modifies the equivalent dipoles used in calculating extracardiac potentials, rendering them oblique rather than normal to the activation wavefront due to an added axial dipole component oriented along the fibers. Herein, however, consequences of the assumption usually made in forward potential calculations that the equivalent dipoles act in a myocardium that is homogeneous and isotropic are examined. A layered inner block representing the heart was placed inside an outer block representing an isotropic volume conductor. Fiber direction in the inner block rotated uniformly from layer to layer. Current dipoles of different orientations were placed in the inner block and the potentials calculated everywhere. Effects of the anisotropy of the inner block were gauged by computing an equivalent dipole that best fit the outer block surface potentials. For volume conductor conductivities close to that of the torso, the anisotropy diminished dipoles oriented along the fibers. Since the intraventricular blood masses in the heart also diminish such dipoles, these reductions of the axial component may explain the success of heart model simulations that ignore this component.},

First clinical results have recently been described on the validation of the sinus rhythm in the human ventricle. In this pilot study the AT imaging approach is applied for the first time to data of the human atrium. Because of the complex anatomy and of the small atrial signal electrical source imaging is a huge challenge. The reconstructed AT pattern for the sinus rhythm on the endo- and epicardium was compared with the CARTO\trademark map obtained for the right atrium in a 21 year-old male patient. The geometrical error for the target chamber was found to be 4.8mm. The spatial dislocation for the first endocardial breakthrough (sinus node activation) was determined with 5mm.},

The model incorporates continuous representation of the multicellular, syncytial cardiac tissue based on the bidomain model. The classical bidomain model is modified by introducing periodic conductivities to better represent the electrical properties of the intracellular space. Thus, junctional discontinuity between abutting myocytes is reflected in the macroscopic representation of cardiac tissue behavior. Since a solution to the resulting coupled differential equations governing the intracellular and extracellular potentials in the tissue preparation is not computationally tractable when traditional numerical approaches, such as finite element or finite difference methods are used, spectral techniques are employed to reduce the problem to the solution of a set of algebraic equations for the transform of the bidomain potentials. Further, the solution to the ``periodic'' bidomain problem in the Fourier space is decomposed into two separate solutions: one for the classical-bidomain potentials where it is assumed that the intracellular conductivity values along and across cells incorporate the average contribution from cytoplasm and junction, and another for the junctional potential component. The decomposition of the total solution allows to approximately solve for the junctional component thus achieving high overall computational efficiency. The results of simulation are presented in an accompanying paper.},

Employing this new model termed the ``periodic'' bidomain model, the steady-state distribution of the transmembrane potential is calculated on a slice of cardiac tissue composed of abutting myocytes and subjected to two point-source extracellular current stimuli. The goal of this study is to examine the relative contribution of cellular discreteness and macroscopic syncytial tissue behavior in the mechanism by which the applied electric field alters the transmembrane potential in cardiac muscle. The results showed the existence of oscillatory changes in the transmembrane potential at cell ends owing to the local resistive inhomogeneities (gap-junctions). This low-magnitude sawtooth component in the transmembrane potential is superimposed over large-scale transmembrane potential excursions associated with the syncytial (collective) fiber behavior. The character of the cardiac response to stimulation is determined primarily by the large-scale syncytial tissue behavior. The sawtooth contributes to the overall tissue response only in regions where the large-scale transmembrane potential component is small.},

  abstract  = {This modeling study demonstrates that a re-entrant activity in a sheet of myocardium can be extinguished by a defibrillation shock delivered via extracellular point-source electrodes which establish spatially non-uniform applied field. The tissue is represented as a homogeneous bidomain with unequal anisotropy ratios in the cardiac conductivities. Spiral wave re-entry is initiated in the bidomain sheet following an S1-S2 stimulation protocol. The results indicate that the point-source defibrillation shock establishes large-scale changes in transmembrane potential in the tissue (virtual electrodes) that are `superimposed' over regions of various degrees of membrane refractoriness in the myocardium. The close proximity of large-scale shock-induced regions of alternating membrane polarity is central to the ability of the shock to terminate the spiral wave. The new wavefronts generated following anode/cathode break phenomena restrict the spiral wave and render the tissue too refractory to further maintain the re-entry. In contrast, shocks delivered via line electrodes establish, in close proximity to the electrode, changes in transmembrane potential that are of same-sign polarity. These shocks are incapable of terminating the re-entrant activation.},

Linear and U-shaped strands (width 100-150 µm) were stained with voltage-sensitive dye. $V_m$ was measured by optical mapping across the width and at sites of beginning curvature. Field pulses were applied transverse to the strands during the action-potential plateau. For linear strands, $V_m$ contained 1) a rapid passive component ($V_m^{ar}$) nearly linear and symmetric across the width, 2) a slower hyperpolarizing component ($V_m^{as}$) greater and faster on the anodal side, and 3) at high field strengths a delayed depolarizing component ($V_m^{ad}$) greater on the anodal side. For U-shaped strands, $V_m$ at sites of beginning curvature also contained rapid and slow components ($V_m^{br}$ and $V_m^{bs}$, respectively) that included contributions from the linear strand response and from the fiber curvature. $V_m^{ar}$, $V_m^{br}$, and part of $V_m^{bs}$ could be attributed to passive behavior that was modeled, and $V_m^{as}$, $V_m^{ad}$, and part of $V_m^{bs}$ could be attributed to active membrane currents. Thus curved strands exhibit field responses separable into components with characteristic amplitude, spatial, and temporal signatures.},

  abstract  = {The intramural dynamics of ventricular fibrillation (VF) remain poorly understood. Recent investigations have suggested that stable intramural reentry may underlie the mechanisms of VF. We performed optical mapping studies of VF in isolated swine right ventricles (RVs) and left ventricles (LVs). Nine RV walls were cut obliquely in their distal edge exposing the transmural surface. Six LV wedge preparations were also studied. Results showed that intramural reentry was present. In RV, 28 of 44 VF episodes showed reentry; 15% of the activation pathways were reentrant. Except for 4 episodes, reentry was transmural, involving subendocardial structures as the papillary muscle (PM) or trabeculae. In LV, reentry was observed in 27 of 27 VF episodes; 23% of the activations were part of reentrant pathways (P<0.05 compared with RV). All LV reentrant pathways were truly intramural (confined to the wall) and were frequently located at the PM insertion. In both ventricles, reentry was spatially and temporally unstable. Histological studies showed abrupt changes in fiber orientation at sites of reentry and wave splitting. Connexin 40 immunostaining demonstrated intramyocardial Purkinje fibers at sites of reentry in the PM root and around endocardial trabeculae. Our results confirm that reentry is frequent--but unstable--in the myocardial wall during VF. In RV, reentry is mostly transmural and requires participation of subendocardial structures. The LV has a greater incidence of reentry and is intramural. Anisotropic anatomic structures played key roles in the generation of wave splitting and in the maintenance of reentry.},

We tested this hypothesis with a combined experimental and theoretical approach. Optical mapping was performed on epicardial, endocardial, and transmural cut surfaces of fibrillating swine ventricles. Wavelets were characterized, the frequency content of optical signals analyzed, and space-time plots (STPs) constructed to detect Wenckebach-like conduction. The findings were compared with simulations in 2D and 3D cardiac tissue using the Luo-Rudy action potential model. The incidence of reentry in the cut transmural surface (11.8% in right ventricle, 14.3% in left ventricle) was similar to that on the endocardial surface (13.1%, P=NS) but greater than on the epicardial surface (7.7%, P<0.01). Frequency spectra of optically recorded membrane voltage were organized into spatial domains with the same dominant frequency, but these domains were nonstationary. In STPs, pseudo-2:1 conduction block was caused by double potentials arising when reentry occurred on the recording site rather than true Wenckebach conduction. The latter was observed in 11 of 166 STPs but did not occur at borders of high-to-low frequency domains. In simulations, similar findings were obtained when action potential duration (APD) restitution slope was steep. Stationary dominant frequency domains with Wenckebach conduction patterns were observed only in the presence of shallow APD restitution slope and marked nonuniform tissue heterogeneity. In conclusion, stable intramural reentry as the engine of fibrillation was not observed. Our findings support the idea that dynamic wavebreak plays a fundamental role in the generation and maintenance of ventricular fibrillation.},

Using this mechanism, it also was possible to evoke reciprocal activity in a one-dimensional cable. In uniform sheets of coupled elements, circus movement of the activation front could be evoked. The presence of an obstacle or dispersion of the refractory periods of the elements was not a prerequisite for the initiation of circus movements. The vortex of circus movements in the homogeneous sheets consisted of elements which were inactivated by depolarizing currents from the circulating wavefront.

The multielectrode QRS morphology during VT is determined by both the site of earliest activation and the subsequent spread of electrical activation through the ventricles. This study investigated the relationship between the site of earliest endocardial activation, endocardial spread of activation, and the morphology of the multielectrode surface map in patients with remote myocardial infarction.\par
  {\em Methods and Results:} In 14 patients with VT late (8.2 ± 5.2 years) after myocardial infarction, BSM and simultaneous left ventricular 64-site basket endocardial mapping was performed during a total of 17 monomorphic VTs. In addition, multisite pacing by sequential use of the 64 basket electrodes was performed in 9 patients. BSM and basket mapping revealed the same endocardial breakthrough sites in 8 (47%) of 17 VTs and 189 (59%) of 322 pacing sites; adjacent sites were found in 2 (12%) of 17 VTs and 36 (11%) of 322 pacing sites. Large zones of conduction block explained the mismatch in localization in 2 (12%) of 17 VTs and 52 (16%) of 322 pacing sites. Regional differences in endocardial electrogram amplitudes were found as a cause for dissimilarity in 3 (18%) of 17 VTs and 73 (23%) of 322 pacing sites. Multiple endocardial breakthrough sites were found in 1 (6%) of 17 VTs and 8 (2%) of 322 pacing sites Finally, an epicardial exit site was suggested in 3 (18%) of 17 VTs as an explanation for mismatch, as no early endocardial activity could be recorded.\par
  {\em Conclusion:} Zones of conduction block, regional differences in signal amplitude, and multiple endocardial breakthrough sites are frequent causes for mismatch between BSM and basket catheter activation mapping.},

  The study uses a realistic source model to simulate potentials throughout the QRS-interval.  This source is placed in an anatomically accurate inhomogeneous volume conductor model of the torso.\par 
  The use of a single value of the regularization parameter is shown to be feasible: for data incorporating 2\% noise, the use of the spatial covariance is demonstrated to result in a relative error over the entire QRS interval as low as 10\%.\par 
  Major errors are demonstrated to result if the effect of the inhomogeneity of the lungs is ignored.  The spatial covariance based inverse is shown to be more robust with respect to the perturbations (noise; inhomogeneity) than the other estimators included in this study.},

The method is based on a description of volumes with spherical harmonics and a database of exact surfaces. Using the spherical harmonic coefficients, sets of basis surfaces are obtained for each compartment. New segmentations can be acquired by combining the appropriate basis surfaces to describe a delineation of the volume in a limited number of magnetic resonance (MR) slices. Alternatively, a representation of the skin can be derived from digitized head shape. Skull and brain then can be predicted from the skin representation with a prediction model also obtained from the segmentation database. Database segmentations were recomputed with the proposed method. Mean deviations from the originals were about 2 and 3 mm for compartments derived from MR and head shape. Dipole simulations with original surfaces for forward and computed segmentations for inverse calculations showed average dipole mislocalizations of 1.6 and 3.3 mm, respectively. With the proposed method highly accurate segmentation can be performed with much less effort and in much less time compared with other techniques. The method also is applicable when MR data is unavailable but a digitization of the head is.},

A method of spatial regularization (SR) was developed and tested in canine, where each spatial spectral component of the volume conductor model was considered separately, and a SR operator was selected based on explicit {\em a posteriori} criterion at each time instant through the heartbeat.  The inverse problem was solved in the left ventricle by reconstructing endocardial surface electrograms based on cavitary electrograms measured with the use of a noncontact, multielectrode probe.
  The results were validated based on electrograms measured in situ at the same endocardial locations using an integrated, multielectrode basket-catheter.  A probe-endocardium three-dimensional model was determined from multiplane fluoroscopic images.  The boundary element method was applied to solve the boundary value problem and derive the relationship between endocardial and probe potentials.  Endocardial electrograms were reconstructed during both normal and paced rhythms using SR as well as standard, uniform, zeroth-order Tikhonov (ZOT) regularization.  Compared to endocardial electrograms measured by the basket, electrograms reconstructed using SR [relative error (RE) = 0.32, correlation

electrograms reconstructed using ZOT regularization (RE = 0.59, CC = 0.79,

  abstract  = {{\bf Objective:} The delayed phase of ventricular arrhythmias during acute ischemia (phase-1b arrhythmia) is associated with depletion of catecholamines and cell-to-cell uncoupling between depressed depolarized intramural ischemic region and surviving cells in subepicardium and subendocardium. In the present study we determined the effects of uncoupling and catecholamines on development of proarrhythmic afterdepolarizations.
  {\bf Methods:} Depressed depolarized ischemic region was simulated by a passive electronic circuit with a potential of -73, -53, -33 or -13 mV. Using patch-clamp methodology, single sheep Purkinje and ventricular cells were coupled to the simulated ischemic region via a variable conductance. By varying coupling conductance, we were able to selectively study the effects of various degrees of uncoupling.
  {\bf Results:} At strong coupling, cells were inexcitable and depolarized to potentials near those of the simulated ischemic region. Excitability, action potential duration and resting potential increased with progressive uncoupling. In a critical range of uncoupling, ventricular and `high-plateau' Purkinje cells developed early afterdepolarizations when the potential of the simulated ischemic region was -13 mV. Norepinephrine (1 \mu M) frequently induced early and delayed afterdepolarizations in both ventricular and Purkinje cells, but these afterdepolarizations were only present during uncoupling when the potential of the simulated ischemic region was -33 mV or more positive.
  {\bf Conclusions:} In a critical range of uncoupling, afterdepolarizations were present when the potential of the simulated ischemic region was -33 or -13 mV, suggesting that triggered activity plays a role in phase-1b arrhythmias when surviving layers uncouple from a highly depolarized intramural ischemic region.},

  abstract  = {Transmural rotation of cardiac fibers may have a large influence on the initiation, stabilization, and termination of several life threatening cardiac arrhythmias. However, three-dimensional modeling of reentry in cardiac tissue is computationally demanding, as a tissue on the order of centimeters in size must be used to sustain reentry and several seconds must be simulated. Numerical accuracy requires time steps on the order of microseconds and spatial discretization on the order of microns. Consequently, the resultant numerical systems are extremely large. In this article, a computationally efficient model of a three-dimensional block of cardiac tissue with fiber rotation is presented. Computational speedup is achieved by using a discrete cable model which allowed for system order reduction, and also by using a scheme for tracking the activation wave front which identified regions requiring integration with a small time step. Simulating 1.2 s of activity of the approximately 2 × 106 cells constituting a block measuring 2.0 × 4.0 × 0.29 cm was performed in 26 h. Effects of model parameters on performance are discussed. The effect of fiber rotation on the spread of electrical activity after point source stimulation and a cross shock protocol is clearly demonstrated.},

This has proven difficult because of the complex morphology of the atria. The purpose of this study was to ascertain the role of specific anatomic structures on reentry induction and maintenance.\par
  {\em Method and Results:} A computationally efficient, morphologically realistic, computer model of the atria was developed that incorporates its major structural features, including discrete electrical connections between the right and left atria, physiologic fiber orientation in three dimensions, muscle structures representing the crista terminalis (CT) and pectinate muscles, and openings for the veins and AV valves. Reentries were induced near the venous openings in the left and right atria, the mouth of the coronary sinus, and the free wall of the right atrium. The roles of certain muscular structures were ascertained by selectively removing the structures and observing how the propagation of activity was affected.\par
  {\em Conclusion:} (1) The muscular sheath of the coronary sinus acts as a pathway for a reentrant circuit and stabilizes any circuits that utilize the isthmus near the inferior vena cava. (2) Poor trans-CT coupling serves to stabilize flutter circuits. (3) Wall thickness is an important factor in the propagation of electrical activity, especially in the left atrium. (4) The openings of the inferior and superior venae cavae form natural anatomic anchors that make reentry easier to initiate by allowing for smaller ectopic beats to induce reentry.},

The initial study demonstrated that low-strength sinusoidal currents can cause hemodynamic collapse without inducing ventricular fibrillation. The present modeling study examines possible electrophysiologic mechanisms leading to such hemodynamic collapse.\par
  {\em Methods and Results:} A strand of cardiac myocytes was subjected to an extracellular sinusoidal current stimulus. The stimulus was located 100 \mu m over one end. Membrane dynamics were described by the Luo-Rudy dynamic model. Examination of the interspike intervals (ISI) revealed that they were dependent on the phase of the stimulus and, as a result, tended to take on discrete values. The frequency dependency of the current threshold to induce an action potential in the cable had a minimum, as has been found experimentally. When a sinus beat was added to the cable, the sinus beat dominated at low-stimulus currents, whereas at high currents the time between action potentials corresponded to the rate observed in a cable without the sinus beat. In between there was a transition region with a wide dispersion of ISIs.\par
  {\em Conclusion:} The following phenomena observed in the initial study were reproduced and explained by the present simulation study: insignificant effect of temporal summation of subthreshold stimuli, frequency dependency of the extrasystole threshold, discrete nature of the ISI, and increase in regularity of the ISI with increasing stimulus strength.},

  abstract  = {{\em Objective:} The long QT syndrome (LQTS) is characterized by prolonged repolarization and propensity to syncope and sudden death due to polymorphic ventricular tachycardias such as torsade de pointes (TdP). The exact mechanism of TdP is unclear, but pause-induced early afterdepolarizations (EADs) have been implicated in its initiation. In this study we investigate the mechanism of pause-induced EADs following pacing at clinically relevant rates and characterize the sensitivity of different cell types (epicardial, midmyocardial, and endocardial) to EAD development.\par
  {\em Methods:} Simulations were conducted using the Luo-Rudy (LRd) model of the mammalian ventricular action potential (AP). Three cell types - epicardial, midmyocardial (M), and endocardial - are represented by altering the channel density of the slow delayed rectifier current, \I{Ks}. LQTS is modelled by enhanced late sodium current (LQT3), or reduced density of functional channels that conduct \I{Kr} (LQT2) and \I{Ks} (LQT1). The cell is paced 40 times at a constant Basic Cycle Length (BCL) of 500 ms. Following a 1500 ms pause, an additional single stimulus is applied.\par
  {\em Results:} Our results demonstrate that pause-induced EADs develop preferentially in M cells under conditions of prolonged repolarization. These EADs develop at plateau potentials (`plateau EADs'). Mechanistic investigation shows that prolongation of the plateau phase of the post-pause AP due to a smaller delayed rectifier potassium current, I{Ks}, and enhancement of the sodium-calcium exchange current, \I{NaCa}, allows for the reactivation of the L-type calcium current, \I{Ca(L)}, which depolarizes the membrane to generate the EAD.\par
  {\em Conclusions:} APD is a very important determinant of arrhythmogenesis and its prolongation, either due to acquired or congenital LQTS, can result in the appearance of EADs. The formation of pause-induced EADs preferentially in M cells suggests a possible role for these cells in the generation of arrhythmias that are associated with abnormalities of repolarization (e.g., TdP). The ionic mechanism of pause-induced EADs involves reactivation of the L-type calcium current during the prolonged plateau of the post-pause AP.},

  abstract  = {{\em Background} -- A growing body of evidence suggests that heterogeneity of ion channel expression and electrophysiological characteristics is an important property of the ventricular myocardium. The 2 components of the delayed rectifier potassium current, \I{Kr} (rapid) and \I{Ks} (slow), play a dominant role in the repolarization of the action potential and are important determinants of its duration.\par
  {\em Methods and Results} -- In this report, the effects of heterogeneities of \I{Kr} and \I{Ks} on action potential duration (APD) and its rate dependence (adaptation) are studied with the use of the LRd model of a mammalian ventricular cell. Results demonstrate the importance of \I{Ks} density variations in heterogeneity of repolarization. Cells with reduced \I{Ks} (eg, mid-myocardial M cells) display long APD and steep dependence of APD on rate. Mechanistically, accumulation of \I{Ks} activation and increased sodium calcium exchange current, \I{NaCa}, secondary to \ionNa accumulation at a fast rate underlie the steep APD-rate relation of these cells. When cells are electrotonically coupled in a multicellular fiber through resistive gap junction, APD differences are reduced. The results demonstrate strong dependence of APD heterogeneity on the degree of intercellular coupling even in the normal physiological range. Highly reduced coupling maximizes APD heterogeneity.\par
  {\em Conclusions} -- Heterogeneity of \I{Ks}:\I{Kr} density strongly influences APD and its rate dependence. However, in the intact myocardium, the degree of gap-junction coupling may be an important factor that determines the manifestation of APD heterogeneity and dispersion of repolarization. The clinical significance of this study is in the context of repolarization abnormalities and associated arrhythmias (eg, long QT syndrome and torsade de pointes).},

  {\em Methods and Results} -- We investigated the effects of reducing \I{Ks} or \I{Kr} or enhancing late \I{Na} (to simulate the 3 forms of long-QT syndrome) on action potential duration (APD) in the context of \I{Ks} heterogeneity. We introduced \I{Ks} heterogeneity in the Luo-Rudy dynamic cell model to simulate epicardial, endocardial, and midmyocardial (M) cells. Results demonstrated higher susceptibility of M cells to the development of arrhythmogenic early afterdepolarizations (EADs) in isolated cells and poorly coupled tissue. An important observation is that \I{Kr} block or late \I{Na} acts to increase APD differences between the cell types, whereas \I{Ks} block minimizes such differences. Also, for normal transverse coupling, EADs develop in the endocardial region rather than in the M region as the result of strong electrotonic interaction.\par
  {\em Conclusions} -- \I{Ks} heterogeneity and intercellular coupling strongly influence EAD development during interventions or disorders that prolong APD. M cells in isolation or in poorly coupled tissue are more susceptible to EAD development than epicardial or endocardial cells. In well-coupled myocardium, EAD formation in the subendocardium can be the source of focal arrhythmias or provide the trigger for reentrant excitation. The efficacy of \I{Ks} block in minimizing APD dispersion could have important implications for antiarrhythmic therapy.},

Here, a two-fold regularization scheme is applied in order to stabilize the inverse solution of this intrinsically ill-posed problem. The solution of the inverse problem is defined by the minimum of a non-linear cost function. The L-curve method can be applied for regularization parameter determination. Solving the optimization problem by a Newton-like method, the L-curve may be of pronged shape. Then a numerically unique determination of the optimal regularization parameter will become difficult. This problem can be avoided applying an iterative linearized algorithm. It is shown that activation time imaging due to temporal and spatial regularization is stable with respect to large model errors. Even neglecting cardiac anisotropy in activation time imaging results in an acceptable inverse solution.},

  abstract  = {{\bf Objectives:} This study was designed to characterize the organization of ventricular fibrillation (VF) on the endocardium of humans.\par
  {\bf Background:} Most proposed mechanisms for the maintenance of VF postulate the propagation of a number of activation wave fronts that reenter to maintain the arrhythmia. We tested the hypothesis that, in patients undergoing internal cardioverter-defibrillator implantation, VF consists primarily of a few large wave fronts on the endocardium.\par
  {\bf Methods:} Electrograms were recorded from a 36-electrode catheter in the left ventricle of 16 patients during VF. Activation times were chosen for a 2-s epoch for each fibrillation episode, and a two-dimensional Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was performed to determine if activation occurred randomly along the catheter over that time interval. The maximum cross-correlation was found for all possible pairs of electrodes on the catheter, and these values were plotted relative to the distance between the two electrodes. An exponential curve was then fit to the data, and a length constant was determined. Activation times were grouped into wave fronts along the catheter, and the lengths of the wave fronts were estimated.\par
  {\bf Results:} The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test showed that activation was not random along the catheter in any of the patients studied. The correlation length determined was 9±2 cm. The number of wave fronts recorded by the catheter was 9.2±2.9 wave fronts/s. The length of the pathway of each wave front along the catheter was 6.5±4.5 cm.\par
  {\bf Conclusions:} Ventricular fibrillation is well organized on the endocardial surface of humans, consisting primarily of a few large wave fronts on the order of 6 to 9 cm.},

Eleven torso models with varying geometry and organ configurations have been studied. For the forward calculations, a standard dipole-like source is placed along the axis of the heart. Inverse calculations are performed using a measured body surface potential distribution and are based on a division of the surface of the heart into 25 source regions, producing epicardial potentials on these regions. A regularization method is used to stabilize the inverse solutions. Both forward and inverse solutions show substantial differences between models.

Using the finite difference method, the contributions of various sources to the impedance cardiogram were studied for the traditional band electrode configuration.  The contributions were categorized into three areas: 1) the structural changes between end diastole and end systole, 2) the flow-induced blood resistivity changes in major arteries and veins, and 3) the lung resistivity variation due to the lung blood volume change.  Based on the models, Z$_O$ and $\Delta$Z between end diastole and end systole were 24.4 $\Omega$ and -0.132 $\Omega$, as compared with the measurements of 21.8 $\Omega$ and -0.123 $\Omega$ made on the same subject from whom the images were taken.  Arterial and venous blood resistivity changes caused approximately 57\% of the total impedance change.  The lung resistivity change and the structural changes contributed 39\% and 4\%, respectively.  The structural changes inside the thorax included the dimensional changes of blood vessels, the blood volume changes of the heart chambers, and heart movement.  Although the net impedance change due to the structural changes was relatively small, the individual variation of various factors was large, with significant cancellation occurring.  The results suggest that the thoracic impedance cardiographic signal is a mixed representation of many inseparable factors and may not be reliable for the stroke volume calculation.  Also, the O-wave, which is clinically observed in various cardiac conditions, may be linked to the diastolic blood flow in the central veins.},

We obtained the following results. 1) SF decreases sharply for propagation into regions of increased electrical load (tissue expansion, increased gap junction coupling, reduced excitability, hyperkalemia); it can be <1 locally (a value indicating conduction failure) and can recover beyond the transition region to resume propagation. 2) SF and propagation across inhomogeneities involve major contribution from \I{Ca(L)}. 3) Modulating \I{Na} or \I{Ca(L)} (by blocking agents or calcium overload) can cause unidirectional block in the inhomogeneous region. 4) Structural inhomogeneity causes local augmentation of \I{Ca(L)} and suppression of \I{Na} in a feedback fashion. 5) Propagation across regions of suppressed \I{Na} is achieved via a \I{Ca(L)}-dependent mechanism. 6) Reduced intercellular coupling can effectively compensate for reduced SF caused by tissue expansion but not by reduced membrane excitability.},

We stimulated the real cell in the central location and determined the critical size of the real cell for successful activation of the entire sheet. We found that this critical size was decreased when anisotropy was present compared with the isotropic case and was further decreased when the central site of stimulation was close to the resistive barrier. The heart normally has some degree of anisotropy, and it has been shown that the remodeling that occurs in peri-infarction zones produces a particular loss of lateral connections compared with end-to-end connections among heart cells. We propose that the normal existence of anisotropy and enhancement of the degree of anisotropy both by loss of lateral gap junctions and the development of resistive barriers may play a facilitating role in the development of ectopic foci that may lead to cardiac arrhythmias.},

  abstract  = {The effect of nontransmural necrosis on epicardial potential distributions was studied in 13 dogs. In previous studies, left ventricular epicardial pacing generated epicardial potential maps at QRS onset with a negative central area and two positive areas that faced the portions of the wavefront propagating along fibers. Subsequently, the positive areas expanded in a counterclockwise direction by 90\degrees to 120\degrees. In those studies, the rotatory expansion of the positive areas was tentatively attributed to the spread of excitation through deep myocardial layers, where fiber direction rotated counterclockwise from epicardium to endocardium. To test this hypothesis, we tried to interrupt the counterclockwise expansion of the positive area by creating localized, nontransmural necrosis at various depths in the left ventricular wall by injection of formalin or application of laser energy. Epicardial potential maps were obtained from a grid of 12 x 15 electrodes on a 44 x 56-mm area. Epicardial pacing from selected sites generated epicardial maps in which some positive areas were missing compared with controls. The direction of the straight line joining the pacing site to the site of missing positivity correlated well with the average fiber direction in the necrotic mass (r = 0.82, p < 0.01). Angle between epicardial fiber direction and the straight line described above correlated well with the average depth of the necrosis, expressed as percent of the wall thickness (r = 0.95, p < 0.01). These data support the hypothesis that the counterclockwise expansion of the epicardial positivity occurring after epicardial pacing results from excitation spreading along deep fibers. The findings are consistent with the oblique dipole layer model of the excitation wavefront. The results may be useful for localizing nontransmural necrosis from epicardial maps.},

Recent work on BSM in Japan is summarized here, with the goals of establishing a normal database and diagnostic criteria by using the standardized mapping system. The standard systems used in Japan are the HPM-7100 and the VCM-3000, manufactured by Fukuda-Denshi (Tokyo, Japan) under the supervision of a committee of the Japanese Circulation Society. The number of leads in this system is 87 (59 on front, 28 on back). As a basic study, a computer simulation was carried out on bundle branch block with myocardial infarction (MI), on late potentials in MI, and finally, on the solution of the inverse problem. The database of 606 normal subjects was established regarding age and sex, and a ``departure index'' (the grade of deviation from normal: the difference between a patient's data the normal mean divided by the normal SD) was proposed. Using the departure index, diagnostic criteria were proposed for the ischemic site, MI site, hypertrophic site of the ventricle, etc. The origin of the ventricular premature contractions was determined by the site of minima and maxima of the QRS and QRST isointegral maps. The site of accessory pathways was determined by the site of minimum less than -0.15 mV on the BSM. For the prediction of patients prone to ventricular tachycardia (VT), several approaches were tried such as multipolar patterns of QRST isointegral maps, Wigner distribution, late potentials with relation to endo- or epicardial delayed potentials, body surface distribution of specific frequency band (25-50 Hz) obtained from fast Fourier transform analysis, and nondipolarity of the QRST isointegral map. To improve the ablation procedure of VT, the author developed a technique to determine the precise location of the VT focus in pace mapping using a correlation matrix between VT and pace maps. To ensure the longevity of the BSM, a reduction of the number of leads has been proposed. The usefulness of BSM has been confirmed and the technique accepted in Japan for daily clinical diagnosis.},

In this paper we examined theoretically the transformation relationship between the anisotropy in a local coordinate system and that in the global coordinate system, considering that the anisotropic conductivity of the skeletal muscle layer is orthogonal in the local coordinate system, but the components of the conductivity tensor may not be directed along the axes of the global coordinate system. In order to show the calculation accuracy of the method, we introduced an example that has an analytical solution. We found that the analytic solution and the numerical one are very close and agreeable.},

  abstract  = {Sudden cardiac death resulting from ventricular fibrillation can be separated into 2 components: initiation of tachycardia and degeneration of tachycardia to fibrillation. Clinical drug studies such as CAST and SWORD demonstrated that focusing exclusively on the first component is inadequate as a therapeutic modality. The hope for developing effective pharmacological therapy rests on a comprehensive understanding of the second component, the transition from tachycardia to fibrillation. We summarize evidence that the transition from tachycardia to fibrillation is a transition to spatiotemporal chaos, with similarities to the quasiperiodic transition to chaos seen in fluid turbulence. In this scenario, chaos results from the interaction of multiple causally independent oscillatory motions. Simulations in 2-dimensional cardiac tissue suggest that the destabilizing oscillatory motions during spiral-wave reentry arise from restitution properties of action potential duration and conduction velocity. The process of spiral-wave breakup in simulated cardiac tissue predicts remarkably well the sequence by which tachycardia degenerates to fibrillation in real cardiac tissue. Modifying action potential duration and conduction velocity restitution characteristics can prevent spiral-wave breakup in simulated cardiac tissue, suggesting that drugs with similar effects in real cardiac tissue may have antifibrillatory efficacy (the Restitution Hypothesis). If valid for the real heart, the Restitution Hypothesis will support a new paradigm for antiarrhythmic drug classification, incorporating an antifibrillatory profile based on effects on cardiac restitution and the traditional antitachycardia profile (classes 1 through 4).},

To simulate the epicardial potentials, an epicardial surface model which enclosed the whole heart was constructed.  The heart model, together with the epicardial surface model, are mounted in an inhomogeneous human torso model.  Electric dipoles, which are proportional to the spatial gradient of the action potential, are generated in all cell units.  These dipoles give rise to a potential distribution on the epicardial surface, which is calculated by means of the boundary element method.

This study determined experimentally whether an artificial discontinuity gives rise to an activation front in response to an electrical stimulus, consistent with the creation of such polarized regions.\par
  {\em Methods and Results} -- After a thoracotomy in six dogs, a 504-unipolar-electrode plaque was sutured to the right ventricular epicardium to map activations. From a line electrode parallel to one side of the plaque, 10 $S_1$ stimuli were delivered, followed by $S_2$ and $S_3$ stimuli ($S_1S_1$, $S_1S_2$, $S_2S_3$ interval=300 ms). $S_1$ and $S_3$ stimuli were 25 mA; 5-ms $S_2$ stimuli of both polarities were initially 25 mA and increased in 25 mA increments. The plaque was removed, and a transmural incision was made through the ventricular wall in the middle of the mapped region and sutured closed. The plaque was replaced and the stimulation protocol repeated. Before the incision, $S_2$ stimuli directly activated tissue only near the stimulation site. An activation front arose at the border of the directly activated region and propagated across the plaque. As the $S_2$ stimulus strength was increased, the size of the directly activated region increased. After the incision, sufficiently large $S_2$ stimuli caused direct activation of tissue adjacent to the transmural incision as well as at the stimulation site. Activation fronts that arose adjacent to the transmural incision either propagated proximally toward the stimulation site and collided with the activation front originating from the stimulation wire or propagated distally away from the incision. Minimum $S_2$ stimulus strengths activating areas adjacent to the incision were only 45±14% (cathode) and 39±18% (anode) of the strengths required to directly activate the same area before the incision was formed (P<.05).\par
  {\em Conclusions} -- Myocardial discontinuities can give rise to activation fronts after a stimulus, suggesting the presence of polarized regions adjacent to the discontinuity.},

  abstract  = {A remarkable feature of healthy ventricular myocardium, exposed by electrical stimulation and high-resolution mapping, is that, despite its gross nonuniformities and structural discontinuities on the submillimeter scale, it behaves electrically so much like a continuous uniformly anisotropic excitable medium. Such media are susceptible to a self-sustaining high-frequency periodic mode of activity in the form of freely movable paired vortices in two dimensions or vortex filaments in three dimensions. These can be evoked by a timely stimulus of the right size, for example, in myocardium by an electrical stimulus during the vulnerable period. Such stimuli may occur at random within complex patterns of stimulation and activation, even in healthy uniform tissue. Discontinuities and heterogeneity apparently make diseased tissue more vulnerable. Such vortices may underlie common reentrant tachycardias that degenerate into ventricular fibrillation, the commonest cause of sudden cardiac death. If the normal mechanism here reviewed also plays a role in diseased tissue, then it provides a quantitative basis for design of improved procedures for management of reentrant ventricular tachycardias that threaten to degrade to fibrillation.},

The heart just switches from its normally periodic pumping to an alternative mode called `fibrillation' more resembling electrical turbulence.  In normal tissue its mechanism is a geometrically re-entrant mode of normal propagation. Everything about this spatial pattern depends upon the magnitude of `D', the one term with dimension involving space in the pertinent biophysical equations.  Explicit or implicit estimates in current literature span orders of magnitude.  In this article I argue from a diversity of recent experiments for a narrower range of realistic values.  It has an important role in the spatio-temporal evolution of fibrillation and in defibrillation.},

  abstract  = {Sudden cardiac death is the leading cause of death in the industrialized world, with the majority of such tragedies being due to ventricular fibrillation. Ventricular fibrillation is a frenzied and irregular disturbance of the heart rhythm that quickly renders the heart incapable of sustaining life. Rotors, electrophysiological structures that emit rotating spiral waves, occur in several systems that all share with the heart the functional properties of excitability and refractoriness. These re-entrant waves, seen in numerical solutions of simplified models of cardiac tissue, may occur during ventricular tachycardias. It has been difficult to detect such forms of re-entry in fibrillating mammalian ventricles. Here we show that, in isolated perfused dog hearts, high spatial and temporal resolution mapping of optical transmembrane potentials can easily detect transiently erupting rotors during the early phase of ventricular fibrillation. This activity is characterized by a relatively high spatiotemporal cross-correlation. During this early fibrillatory interval, frequent wavefront collisions and wavebreak generation are also dominant features. Interestingly, this spatiotemporal pattern undergoes an evolution to a less highly spatially correlated mechanism that lacks the epicardial manifestations of rotors despite continued myocardial perfusion.},

  {\em Methods and Results}--We developed a new technique for online 3D localization of intracardiac electrodes. Regular catheter electrodes are used as sensors for a high-frequency transthoracic electrical field, which is applied via standard skin electrodes. We investigated localization accuracy within the right atrium, right ventricle, and left ventricle by comparing measured and true interelectrode distances of a decapolar catheter. Long-term stability was analyzed by localization of the most proximal His bundle before and after slow pathway ablation. Electrogram recordings were unaffected by the applied electrical field. Localization data from 3 catheter positions, widely distributed within the right atrium, right ventricle, or left ventricle, were analyzed in 10 patients per group. The relationship between measured and true electrode positions was highly linear, with an average correlation coefficient of 0.996, 0.997, and 0.999 for the right atrium, right ventricle, and left ventricle, respectively. Localization accuracy was better than 2 mm, with an additional scaling error of 8% to 14%. After 2 hours, localization of the proximal His bundle was reproducible within 1.4±1.1 mm.\par
  {\em Conclusions}--This new technique enables accurate and reproducible real-time localization of electrode positions in cardiac mapping and ablation procedures. Its application does not distort the quality of electrograms and can be applied to any electrode catheter.},

Electromechanical mapping of the left ventricle was performed in a control group ($n$ = 10) and 4 wk after left anterior descending coronary artery ligation ($n$ = 10). Impedance, bipolar electrogram amplitude, and endocardial local shortening (LS) were quantified. The infarcted area was compared with the corresponding regions in controls, revealing a significant reduction in impedance values [infarcted vs. controls: 168.8 ± 11.7 and 240.7 ± 22.3  $\Omega$, respectively (means ± SE), P < 0.05] bipolar electrogram amplitude (1.8 ± 0.2 mV, 4.4 ± 0.7 mV, P < 0.05), and LS ( [-] 2.36 ± 1.6%, 11.9 ± 0.9%, P < 0.05) The accuracy of the impedance maps in delineating the location and extent of the infarcted region was demonstrated by the high correlation with the infarct area (Pearson's correlation coefficient = 0.942) and the accurate identification of the infarct borders in pathology. By accurately defining myocardial infarction and its borders, endocardial impedance mapping may become a clinically useful tool in differentiating healthy from necrotic myocardial tissue.},

The present experimental results show that the two types of finite difference Laplacian estimates are highly correlated and have a consistent spatial distribution over the anterolateral chest during normal ventricular activation. The present computer simulation and human experiment results suggest the feasibility of estimating the body surface Laplacian maps (BSLMs) from potentials using the finite difference algorithm over the anterior chest in male subjects. The noise levels of the BSLMs over the anterolateral chest were quantitatively compared to the noise levels in corresponding body surface potential maps (BSPMs) in 12 healthy subjects. The simulation and experiment results indicate that the noise to signal ratios in the BSLMs over the anterolateral chest during ventricular activation is about 5 times that of the BSPMs, when no signal processing is performed.},

  abstract  = {Point cathodal stimulation of cardiac tissue was shown previously to produce both a dog-bone shaped virtual cathode transverse to the muscle fibers and two longitudinal virtual anodes. We hypothesize that virtual anodes can cause a region of delayed activation, separating two regions of early activation caused by the virtual cathode. Using a high-density electrode array in 42 superfused epicardial slices from 14 canine left ventricles, we observed regions of early and delayed activation and different pathways of retrograde propagation corresponding to the earlier patterns. Retrograde propagation was seen from the transversely located early activation area through areas of delayed activation toward the cathode, and from the early activation area toward the cathode directly. These pathways caused a wide dispersion in the direction of retrograde propagation (2°±31°, n = 179, relative to the fast axis of threshold activation; radial velocity: 0.5±0.2 m/s, n = 95, in 12 slices from 8 hearts with stimuli of 330 µs, 0.8-30 mA). Delayed activations were observed 0°±6° (n = 32) from the axis in 23 maps (at differing stimulation strengths) recorded in 13 slices from 10 hearts. We conclude that point cathodal stimulation induce delayed activation along the fiber axis and retrograde propagation both along and transverse to the axis.},

In this study, we investigated how dynamic factors and fixed electrophysiological heterogeneity interact to promote wave break in simulated two-dimensional cardiac tissue, by using the Luo-Rudy (LR1) ventricular action potential model. The degree of dynamic instability of the action potential model was controlled by varying the maximal amplitude of the slow inward Ca2+ current to produce spiral waves in homogeneous tissue that were either nearly stable, meandering, hypermeandering, or in breakup regimes. Fixed electrophysiological heterogeneity was modeled by randomly varying action potential duration over different spatial scales to create dispersion of refractoriness. We found that the degree of dispersion of refractoriness required to induce wave break decreased markedly as dynamic instability of the cardiac model increased. These findings suggest that reducing the dynamic instability of cardiac cells by interventions, such as decreasing the steepness of action potential duration restitution, may still have merit as an antifibrillatory strategy.},

However, steep action potential duration restitution, recently proposed to be a major determinant of VF, is typically decreased rather than increased by hyperkalemia and acute ischemia. To investigate this apparent contradiction, we simulated the effects of regional hyperkalemia and other ischemic components (anoxia and acidosis) on the stability of spiral wave reentry in simulated two-dimensional cardiac tissue by use of the Luo-Rudy ventricular action potential model. We found that the hyperkalemic ``ischemic'' area promotes wavebreak in the surrounding normal tissue by accelerating the rate of spiral wave reentry, even after the depolarized ischemic area itself has become unexcitable. Furthermore, wavebreak and fibrillation can be prevented if the dynamical instability of the normal tissue is reduced significantly by targeting electrical restitution properties, suggesting a novel therapeutic approach.},

Site classifications based on the observed body surface potential maps (BSPMs) during ventricular endocardial pacing, as well as on the patterns of the QRS integrals of these maps, have been suggested. The goals of this study were to verify these maps and their QRS integral patterns via simulation using a computer heart model with realistic geometry and to determine whether the model could improve clinical understanding of these ectopic patterns. Simulation was achieved by initiating excitation of the heart model at different endocardial sites and their overlying epicardial counterparts. This excitation propagated in anisotropic fashion in the myocardium. Retrograde excitation of the model's His-Purkinje conduction system was necessary to obtain realistic activation durations. Simulated BSPMs, computed by placing the heart model inside a numerical torso model, and their QRS integrals were close to those observed clinically. Small differences in QRS integral map patterns and in the positions of the QRS integral map extrema were noted for endocardial sites in the left septal and anteroseptal regions. The simulated BSPMs during early QRS for an endocardial site and its epicardial counterpart tended to be mirror images about the zero isopotential contour, exchanging positive and negative map regions. The simulation results attest to the model's ability to reproduce accurately clinically recorded body surface potential distributions obtained following endocardial stimulation. The QRS integral maps from endocardial sites in the left septal and anteroseptal regions were the most labile, owing to considerable cancellation effects. Conventional BSPMs can be useful to help distinguish between endocardial and epicardial ectopic sites.},

  abstract  = {The body surface isopotential maps of 22 patients with WPW syndrome were obtained from the 85 unipolar lead ECG's using the on-line minicomputer system newly devised by the author's group. The map patterns were classified into three types-I, II, and III (Type I, eight; Type II, seven; Type III, three; and unclassified, four cases). In Type I, the back surface displayed the negative potential throughout the entire ventricular activation, and at the terminal stage the lower precordial area displayed the positive potential and the upper precordial area, the negative one. Type II was characterized by two longitudinal lines, one staying at its place on the back and the other moving right to left on the precordial area following the process of ventricular activation. In Type III, the right precordial area displayed negative potential in the early stage, and in the terminal stage the upper part of the right side of chest surface displayed positive potential and the lower part, negative potential. It was surmised from these patterns that the pre-excited area was located at the posterior region of the ventricles in Type I, at the right ventricle in Type II, and the right ventricular base near the posterior margin of the ventricular septum in Type III. Type A patients in the conventional ECG classification fell under Type I; Type C patients, under Type III; Type B patients under either Type I or Type II.},

  abstract  = {{\em Background}--This study probes the cellular basis for the T wave under baseline and long-QT (LQT) conditions using an arterially perfused canine left ventricular (LV) wedge preparation, which permits direct temporal correlation of cellular transmembrane and ECG events.\par
  {\em Methods and Results}--Floating microelectrodes were used to record transmembrane action potentials (APs) simultaneously from epicardial, M-region, and endocardial sites or subendocardial Purkinje fibers. A transmural ECG was recorded concurrently. Under baseline and LQT conditions, repolarization of the epicardial action potential, the earliest to repolarize, coincided with the peak of the T wave; repolarization of the M cells, the last to repolarize, coincided with the end of the T wave. Thus, the action potential duration (APD) of the longest M cells determine the QT interval and the T$_peak$-T$_end$ interval serves as an index of transmural dispersion of repolarization. Repolarization of Purkinje fibers outlasted that of the M cell but failed to register on the ECG. The morphology of the T wave appeared to be due to currents flowing down voltage gradients on either side of the M region during phase 2 and phase 3 of the ventricular action potential. The interplay between these opposing forces determined the height of the T wave as well as the degree to which the ascending or descending limb of the T wave was interrupted, giving rise to bifurcated T waves and ``apparent T-U complexes'' under LQT conditions. Spontaneous and stimulation-induced polymorphic ventricular tachycardia with characteristics of torsade de pointes (TdP) developed in the presence of dl-sotalol.\par
  {\em Conclusions}--Our results provide the first direct evidence that opposing voltage gradients between epicardium and the M region and endocardium and the M region contribute prominently to the inscription of the ECG T wave under normal conditions and to the widened or bifurcated T wave and long-QT interval observed under LQT conditions. Our data suggest that the ``pathophysiological U'' wave observed in acquired or congenital LQTS is more likely to be a second component of an interrupted T wave, and argue for use of the term T2 in place of U to describe this event.},

New applications, such as panoramic imaging, three-dimensional imaging, and quantitative imaging, are now beginning to be offered on some commercial ultrasound machines and are expected to grow in popularity. In this review, we focus on the various algorithms, their processing requirements, and the challenges of these ultrasound modes. Whereas the older, mature B and color-flow modes could be systolically implemented using hardwired components and boards, new applications, such as three-dimensional imaging and image feature extraction, are being implemented more by using programmable processors. This trend toward programmable ultrasound machines will continue, because the programmable approach offers the advantages of quick implementation of new applications without any additional hardware and the flexibility to adapt to the changing requirements of these dynamic new applications.},

  abstract  = {{\em Objectives.} This study tested the correlation of QT and JT dispersion and other potentially useful electrocardiographic (ECG) indexes with dispersion of repolarization and recovery time.\par
  {\em Background.} Dispersion of ventricular repolarization is currently being assessed noninvasively from the surface ECG by means of QT and JT dispersion, although their correlation with dispersion of repolarization as measured directly from the myocardium is not well established.\par
  {\em Methods.} Multiple monophasic action potentials were recorded simultaneously with a 12-lead ECG from isolated Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts. The QT and JT dispersion was compared with the dispersion of monophasic action potential duration at 90% repolarization (APD90) and with dispersion of recovery time. As new ECG indexes, total T wave area, T wave area after the peak (late T wave area) and T peak to T end interval were also tested.\par
  {\em Results.} The QT and JT dispersion showed a significant correlation with the dispersion of APD90 and the dispersion of recovery time (r values between 0.58 and 0.64, respectively, p < 0.001). However, total T wave area showed better correlation, respectively, with dispersion of APD90 and recovery time (r = 0.79 and r = 0.82, p < 0.0001), as did late T wave area (r = 0.81 and r = 0.81, p < 0.0001) and T peak to T end interval (r = 0.81 and r = 0.82, p < 0.0001).\par
  {\em Conclusions.} The JT and QT dispersion correlate significantly with dispersion of APD90 and recovery time. The ECG assessment of dispersion of repolarization can be improved by three new ECG dispersion indexes: T peak to T end interval, total T wave area and late T wave area. These new indexes should be tested clinically.},

The aim of the present prospective study was to evaluate the prognostic value of QTD and other ECG variables reflecting dispersion of ventricular repolarization in comparison with established risk stratifiers during long-term follow-up in a large cohort of post-myocardial infarction patients treated according to contemporary therapeutic guidelines.\par
  {\em Methods and Results} -- In 280 consecutive infarct survivors, the 12-lead ECG was optically scanned and digitized for analysis of QTD (QT_{max}-QT_{min}) and 25 other repolarization variables, including recently developed and validated parameters such as the T peak-to-T end interval and the area under the T wave. In addition, a variety of established risk stratifiers were assessed. After a mean follow-up period of 32±10 months, 30 patients reached one of the prospectively defined study end points (death, ventricular tachycardia, or resuscitated ventricular fibrillation). Comparisons between event and nonevent patients by means of Kaplan-Meier event probability analyses revealed that none of the ECG dispersion variables were of discriminative value. In contrast, variables such as left ventricular ejection fraction (P=0.007), mean 24-hour heart rate (P=0.022), or heart rate variability (P=0.007) proved to be potentially useful risk stratifiers in this patient population. On multivariate analysis, only LVEF, heart rate variability, and a history of thrombolysis were independent predictors of outcome.\par
  {\em Conclusions} -- Determination of QTD from the surface ECG even when performed with the best available methodology failed to predict subsequent risk in this large series of infarct survivors.},

  {\em Methods and Results} -- In 280 consecutive post-MI patients, a 12-lead ECG was recorded before discharge, optically scanned, and digitized. For the present study, 5 T-wave morphology descriptors were automatically calculated after singular value decomposition of the ECG signal. The total cosine R-to-T (TCRT [describes the global angle between repolarization and depolarization wavefront]) and the T-wave loop dispersion were univariately associated (P=0.0002 and P<0.002, respectively, U test) with 27 prospectively defined clinical events in 261 patients (mean follow-up 32±10 months). Kaplan-Meier event probability curves for strata above and below the median confirmed the strong risk discrimination by TCRT and T-wave loop dispersion (P<0.003 and P<0.001, respectively, log-rank test). On Cox regression analysis, with the entering of age, left ventricular ejection fraction, heart rate, QRS width, reperfusion therapy, ß-adrenergic-blocker treatment, and standard deviation of R-R intervals on 24-hour Holter monitoring, TCRT (P<0.03) yielded independent predictive value, whereas T-wave loop dispersion was of borderline independence (P=0.064). Heart rate (P<0.02), left ventricular ejection fraction (P<0.02), and reperfusion therapy (P<0.02) also remained in the final model.\par
  {\em Conclusions} -- Computerized T-wave morphology analysis of the 12-lead resting ECG permits independent assessment of post-MI risk and an improved risk stratification when combined with other risk markers.},

  abstract  = {Two distinct delayed rectifier \ionK currents, \I{Kr} and \I{Ks}, were found recently in ventricular cells. We formulated these currents theoretically and investigated their roles in action potential repolarization and the restitution of action potential duration (APD). The Luo-Rudy (L-R) model of the ventricular action potential was used in the simulations. The single delayed rectifier \ionK current in the model was replaced by \I{Kr} and \I{Ks}. Our results show that \I{Ks} is the major outward current during the plateau repolarization. A specific block of either \I{Kr} or \I{Ks} can effectively prolong APD to the same degree. Therefore, either channel provides a target for class \I{II} antiarrhythmic drugs. \I{n} the simulated guinea pig ventricular cell, complete block of \I{Kr} does not result in early afterdepolarizations (EADs). \I{n} contrast, >80% block of \I{Ks} results in abnormal repolarization and EADs. This behavior reflects the high \I{Ks}-to-\I{Kr} density ratio (\sim 8:1) in this cell and can be reversed (ie, \I{Kr} block can cause EADs) by reducing the ratio of \I{ks} to \I{Kr}. The computed APD restitution curve is consistent with the experimental behavior, displaying fast APD variation at short diastolic intervals (DIs) and downward shift at longer DIs with the decrease of basic drive cycle length (BCL). Examining the ionic currents and their underlying kinetic processes, we found that activation of both \I{Kr} and \I{Ks} is the primary determinant of the APD restitution at shorter DIs, with \ionCa current through L-type channels (\I{Ca}) playing a minor role. The rate of APD change depends on the relative densities of \I{Kr} and \I{Ks}; it increases when the \I{Kr}-to-\I{Ks} density ratio is large. The BCL-dependent shift of restitution at longer DIs is primarily attributed to long-lasting changes in $[\ionCa]_i$. This in turn causes different degrees of \ionCa-dependent inactivation of \I{Ca} and different degrees of \ionCa-dependent conductance of \I{Ks} at very long DIs (>5 s) for different BCLs. This BCL dependence of \I{Ca} and \I{Ks} that is secondary to long-lasting changes in $[\ionCa]_i$ is responsible for APD changes at long DIs and can be viewed as a "memory property" of cardiac cells.},

After 20 S1 stimuli, a 10-ms square wave S2 shock field with a 30-ms S1-S2 coupling interval was given via patch shock electrodes 1 cm on either side of the tissue during the action potential plateau. Two shock strengths (2.1±0.2 and 6.5±0.6 V/cm) were tested with both shock polarities. The recording site was moved across the tissue along fibers with either 200 µm (macroscopic group [n=5], 12 consecutive recording sites over a 2.2-mm tissue length in each muscle) or 20 µm (microscopic group [n=5], 21 consecutive recording sites over a 0.4-mm tissue length in each muscle) between adjacent recording sites. In the macroscopic group, the portion of the tissue toward the anode was hyperpolarized, whereas the portion toward the cathode was depolarized, with 1 zero-potential crossing from hyperpolarization to depolarization present near the center of the tissue. In the microscopic group, only 1 zero-potential crossing was observed in the center region of the tissue, whereas, away from the center, only hyperpolarization was observed toward the anode and depolarization toward the cathode. Although these results are consistent with predictions from field stimulation of continuous representations of myocardial structure, ie, the bidomain and cable equation models, they are not consistent with the prediction of depolarization-hyperpolarization oscillation from representations based on cellular-level resistive discontinuities associated with gap junctions, ie, the sawtooth model.},
