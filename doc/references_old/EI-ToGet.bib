  abstract  = {The discovery and characterization of the M cell, a unique cell type residing in the deep layers of the ventricular myocardium, has opened a new door in one's understanding of the electrophysiology and pharmacology of the heart in both health and disease. The hallmark of the M cell is the ability of its action potential to prolong much more than that of other ventricular myocardial cells in response to a slowing of rate and/or in response to agents that act to prolong action potential duration. The authors' goal in this review is to provide a comprehensive characterization of the M cell, its contribution to transmural heterogeneity, and its role in the normal electrical function of the heart, in the inscription of the ECG (particularly the T wave), and in the development of QT dispersion, T wave alternans, long QT intervals, and cardiac arrhythmias, such as torsades de pointes. The authors' secondary goal is to address the controversy that has arisen relative to the functional importance of the M cell in the normal heart. The controversy derives largely from the failure of some investigators to demonstrate transmural heterogeneity of repolarization in the dog in vivo under control conditions and after administration of quinidine. The inability to demonstrate transmural heterogeneity under these conditions may be due to the use of bipolar recording techniques that, in the authors' experience, seriously underestimate transmural dispersion of repolarization (TDR). The use of sodium pentobarbital and \alpha-chloralose as anesthesia also is problematic, because these agents reduce or eliminate TDR by affecting a variety of ion channel currents. Finally, attempts to amplify transmural dispersion of repolarization with an agent such as quinidine must take into account that relatively high concentrations can result in effects opposite to those desired due to drug inhibition of multiple ion channels. These observations may explain the inability of earlier studies to detect the M cell.},

Rather, we have confirmed, conceivably ad nauseum, that M cells do exist and contribute importantly to the expression of electrical activity in the intact myocardium. What controversy there is relates to (1) whether there is an inhomogeneous transmural gradient for ventricular repolarization in normal hearts, and (2) why the electrophysiologic properties of different myocardial sites differ so markedly at the level of the isolated tissue and single cell and yet become so much more homogenous in the intact ventricle.

Because lesions due to radiofrequency (RF) current are small and well defined, it may allow precise localization of accessory pathways. The purpose of this study was to use RF catheter ablation to develop an ECG algorithm to predict accessory pathway location.\par
  {\em Methods and Results:} An algorithm was developed by correlating a resting 12-lead ECG with the successful RF ablation site in 135 consecutive patients with a single, anterogradely conducting accessory pathway (Retrospective phase). This algorithm was subsequently tested prospectively in 121 consecutive patients (Prospective phase). The ECG findings included the initial 20 msec of the delta wave in leads I, II, aVF, and V-1 [classified as positive (+), negative (-), or isoelectric (+/-)] and the ratio of R and S wave amplitudes in leads III and V-1 (classified as R greater than or equal to S or R < S). When tested prospectively, the ECG algorithm accurately localized the accessory pathway to 1 of 10 sites around the tricuspid and mitral annuli or at subepicardial locations within the venous system of the heart. Overall sensitivity was 90% and specificity was 99%. The algorithm was particularly useful in correctly localizing anteroseptal (sensitivity 75%, specificity 99%), and mid-septal (sensitivity 100%, specificity 98%) accessory pathways as well as pathways requiring ablation from within ventricular venous branches or anomalies of the coronary sinus (sensitivity 100%, specificity 100%).\par
  {\em Conclusion:} A simple ECG algorithm identifies accessory pathway ablation site in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. A truly negative delta wave in lead II predicts ablation within the coronary venous system.},

We studied the effect of autonomic variations on several new descriptors of the three-dimensional T loop. Twelve-lead digital ECGs were recorded continuously in 40 healthy subjects at baseline in the supine position, during postural changes (supine-->sitting-->standing-->supine-->standing), and during Valsalva maneuver performed three times in the supine and three times in the standing positions. A minimum dimensional space was constructed from the 12-lead ECG, using singular value decomposition, on the basis of median ECG beats constructed from 10-second consecutive ECG recordings. Temporal variations (TLA and PL, which measure the T loop area, and LD, the interlead relationship during repolarization) and wavefront direction descriptors (TCRT, the deviation between the QRS and T vectors) were calculated and expressed as normalized values. Values of TLA, PL, and TCRT were significantly lower in the sitting than in the supine position (-38,139 +/- 9099 vs 47,133 +/- 7511, -0.017 +/- 0.005 vs 0.033 +/- 0.005 and -0.032 +/- 0.019 vs 0.071 +/- 0.015, respectively, P < 0.001 for all) and decreased further in the standing position (-88,288 +/- 14,468, -0.067 +/- 0.013, -0.198 +/- 0.025, respectively, P < 0.001 for all). LD increased from supine to sitting (98.7 +/- 29.4 vs -87.5 +/- 15.2, P < 0.001) and increased further, though nonsignificantly in the standing position (118.3 +/- 35.2). TLA, PL, and TCRT decreased from baseline during Valsalva in the supine (-34,118 +/- 11,424 vs 62,234 +/- 12,215, -0.038 +/- 0.014 vs 0.065 +/- 0.010, -0.08 +/- 0.03 vs 0.10 +/- 0.02, respectively, P < 0.001 for all) and standing positions (-108,263 +/- 21,051 vs -68,909 +/- 10,271, -0.109 +/- 0.014 vs -0.048 +/- 0.009, -0.30 +/- 0.035 vs -015 +/- 0.016, respectively, P < 0.05 for all).

There were significant correlations among TLA, PL, and LD, and no significant correlation between TCRT and any of the temporal variation descriptors. These new temporal and wavefront direction descriptors are sensitive and rapid detectors of autonomic effects on ventricular repolarization.},

In this paper the authors take a fundamental step in extending the theory to certain nonlinear ill-posed problems. Specifically, for a continuous weakly closed nonlinear operator on a Hilbert space they establish that Tikhonov's method provides a stable (with respect to errors in the data) approximation procedure for a minimum-norm solution. Under appropriate conditions an asymptotic convergence rate of the form $O(\sqrt{\delta})$, where $\delta$ is a bound for the error in the data, is established. The results are illustrated for certain nonlinear coefficient estimation problems for two-point boundary value problems and for a nonlinear integral equation of the first kind. In an interesting appendix the relationship between the ill-posedness of a nonlinear problem and the ill-posedness of its linearizations is explored. The surprising conclusion is that there is essentially no relationship at all!},

They illustrate these conditions for several examples including parameter estimation problems. In an appendix, they study the connection between the ill-posedness of a non-linear problem and its linearisation and show that this connection is rather weak. A sufficient condition for ill-posedness is given in the case that the non-linear operator is compact.},

This is based on the demonstration that such measurements allow localization of the relative extrema of the ventricular surface activation map (given a forward problem solution), which in turn restricts the space of admissible solution maps to a compact set. Although the inverse problem and the problem of identifying derivative discontinuities are both ill-posed, it is possible that the latter may be more easily or justifiably resolved with available information, particularly as current methods for regularizing the inverse problem typically rely on a regularization parameter chosen in an a posteriori fashion. An example of the power of the approach is the demonstration that a recent Uniform Dipole Layer Hypothesis-based method for producing the ventricular surface activation map is largely independent on that hypothesis and capable in principle of generating maps that are very similar in a precise sense to those that would result from the usual epicardial potential formulation (assuming the latter were capable of producing intrinsic deflections in computed epicardial electrograms sufficiently steep to accurately compute the activation map). This is consistent with the preliminary success of the former method, despite the significant inaccuracy of its underlying assumption.},

  abstract  = {INTRODUCTION: A modeling study is presented to explore the effects of tissue conductivity, fiber orientation, and presence of an adjoining extracellular volume conductor on electrical conduction in cardiac muscle. Simulated results are compared with those of classical in vitro experiments on superfused thin layer preparations and on whole hearts.\par
  METHODS AND RESULTS: The tissue is modeled as a three-dimensional bidomain block adjoining an isotropic bath. In the thin layer model, the fibers are assumed parallel. In the thick block model, fiber rotation, curvature, and tipping are incorporated. Results from the thin layer model explain experimental observations that the rate of rise of the entire action potential upstroke is faster and the magnitude of the extracellular potential is smaller across fibers than along fibers in a uniformly propagating front. The simulation identified that this behavior only arises in tissue with unequal anisotropy in the two spaces and adjoining an extracellular bath. Simulated conduction and potential distributions in the thick block model are shown to well approximate experimental maps. The potentials are sensitive to changes in the fiber orientations. A slight 5 degrees tipping of intramural fibers out of the planes parallel to the epicardium and endocardium will lead to an asymmetry of the magnitudes of the positive regions. In addition, the introduction of fiber curvature leads to more realistic isochrone and extracellular potential distributions. The orientation of the central negative region of the extracellular potential is shown to be determined by the average of the fiber direction at the plane of pacing and the plane of recording.\par
  CONCLUSIONS: The simulations demonstrate the sensitivity of spread of activation and potential time courses and distributions to the underlying electrical properties in both thick and thin slabs. The bidomain model is shown to be a useful representation of cardiac tissue for interpreting experimental data of activation.},

An anatomical model of the human ventricular myocardium is used to simulate body surface potential maps (BSPMs) and magnetic field maps (MFMs) for 35 pre-excitation sites positioned on the epicardial surface along the atrioventricular ring. The sites of pre-excitation activity are estimated by the single-dipole method, and the measure for the accuracy of the localisation is the localisation error, defined as the distance between the location of the best-fitting single dipole and the actual site of pre-excitation in the ventricular model. The findings indicate that, when the electrical properties of the volume conductor and lead positions are precisely known and the 'measurement' noise is added to the simulated BSPMs and MFMs, the single-dipole method optimally localises the pre-excitation activity 20 ms after the onset of pre-excitation, within 0.71 +/- 0.28 cm and 0.65 +/- 0.30 cm using BSPMs and MFMs, respectively. When the standard torso model is used to localise the sites of onset of the pre-excitation sequence initiated in four individualised torso models, the maximum errors are as high as 2.6-3.0 cm (even though the average error, for both the BSPM and MFM localisations, remains within the 1.0-1.5 cm range). In spite of these shortcomings, it is thought that single-dipole localisations can be useful for non-invasive pre-interventional planning.},

  abstract  = {Using computer simulations, we systematically investigated the limitations of an inverse solution that employs the potential distribution on the epicardial surface as an equivalent source model in localizing pre-excitation sites in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. A model of the human ventricular myocardium that features an anatomically accurate geometry, an intramural rotating anisotropy and a computational implementation of the excitation process based on electrotonic interactions among cells, was used to simulate body surface potential maps (BSPMs) for 35 pre-excitation sites positioned along the atrioventricular ring. Two individualized torso models were used to account for variations in torso boundaries. Epicardial potential maps (EPMs) were computed using the L-curve inverse solution. The measure for accuracy of the localization was the distance between a position of the minimum in the inverse EPMs and the actual site of pre-excitation in the ventricular model. When the volume conductor properties and lead positions of the torso were precisely known and the measurement noise was added to the simulated BSPMs, the minimum in the inverse EPMs was at 12 ms after the onset on average within 0.65 +/- 0.26 cm of the pre-excitation site. When the standard torso model was used to localize the sites of onset of the pre-excitation sequence initiated in individualized male and female torso models, the mean distance between the minimum and the pre-excitation site was 0.67 +/- 0.31 cm for the male torso and 0.82 +/- 0.53 cm for the female torso. The findings of our study indicate that a location of the minimum in EPMs computed using the inverse solution can offer non-invasive means for pre-interventional planning of the ablative treatment.},

BSPMs and MFMs are calculated for the simulated activation sequences initiated at 35 pre-excitation sites located along the atrioventricular (AV) ring of the epicardium. Changes in the BSPMs and MFMs corresponding to different pre-excitation sites are quantified in terms of the correlation coefficient r. The spatial resolution (selectivity) for a given pre-excitation site is defined as the half-distance between those neighbouring locations at which morphological features of maps, in terms of r, become distinct (r < 0.95). It is found that, at 28 ms after the onset of pre-excitation and with no noise added, this distance +/- SD, for all sites along the AV ring for the 117-lead BSPMs, is 0.83 +/- 0.32 cm, and for the 64-lead and 128-lead MFMs it is 1.54 +/- 0.84 cm and 1.15 +/- 0.43 cm, respectively. The findings suggest that, when features of non-invasively recorded electrocardiographic and magnetocardiographic map patterns are used for identifying accessory pathways in patients suffering from WPW syndrome, BSPMs are likely to provide more detailed information for guiding the ablative treatment than MFMs. For some sites MFMs provide more information. Both modalities may provide additional assistance to the cardiologist in locating the site of the accessory pathway.},

In an anatomical model of the human ventricular myocardium, pre-excitation sequences were initiated at 69 sites positioned along the atrioventricular (AV) ring and corresponding body surface potential maps (BSPMs) were calculated at 32 leads placed on the anterior torso. For each time after the onset of pre-excitation (every 4 ms to 40 ms) and each root-mean-square (RMS) noise level (5, 10, 20 and 50 $\mu$V), BSPMs were cros-correlated and the spatial resolution defined as the largest pacing site separation at which the differences in correlation coefficients were not statistically significant (level p > or = 0.05). The findings indicate that when random RMS noise of 5 $\mu$V was added to the simulated BSPMs, average spatial resolution over all 60 sites was at 20 ms after the onset of pre-excitation within 3.5 +/- 0.9 mm.

The magnitude of this instability is demonstrated using the derived analytical inverse solution for the spherical model. Regularization methods used to date are based on a regularization parameter that does not relate to any measurable physiological parameters. This paper presents a regularization method that is based on a parameter in the form of an a priori bound on the L2 norm of the inverse solution. Such a bound can be obtained from the theoretical estimates based on the measured values of the body surface potentials together with experimental knowledge about the magnitudes of the epicardial potentials.

  abstract  = {The inverse problem of electrocardiography, the computation of epicardial potentials from body surface potentials, is influenced by the desired resolution on the epicardium, the number of recording points on the body surface, and the method of limiting the inversion process. To examine the role of these variables in the computation of the inverse transform, Tikhonov's zero-order regularization and singular value decomposition (SVD) have been used to invert the forward transfer matrix. The inverses have been compared in a data-independent manner using the resolution and the noise amplification as endpoints. Sets of 32, 50, 192, and 384 leads were chosen as sets of body surface data, and 26, 50, 74, and 98 regions were chosen to represent the epicardium. The resolution and noise were both improved by using a greater number of electrodes on the body surface. When 60% of the singular values are retained, the results show a trade-off between noise and resolution, with typical maximal epicardial noise levels of less than 0.5% of maximum epicardial potentials for 26 epicardial regions, 2.5% for 50 epicardial regions, 7.5% for 74 epicardial regions, and 50% for 98 epicardial regions. As the number of epicardial regions is increased, the regularization technique effectively fixes the noise amplification but markedly decreases the resolution, whereas SVD results in an increase in noise and a moderate decrease in resolution. Overall the regularization technique performs slightly better than SVD in the noise-resolution relationship. There is a region at the posterior of the heart that was poorly resolved regardless of the number of regions chosen. The variance of the resolution was such as to suggest the use of variable-size epicardial regions based on the resolution.},

We evaluated a nonfluoroscopic three-dimensional mapping system, termed CARTO, and compared the results of ablation using this technique with those of conventional mapping.\par
  {\em METHODS AND RESULTS:} We compared the results of 88 arrhythmia ablations (79 patients) using CARTO with 100 ablations (94 patients) using the conventional technique. The ablations were separated into four groups: (1) AV nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT); (2) atrial tachycardia/flutter; (3) ventricular tachycardia (VT); and (4) bypass tract tachycardia. We compared the success rate, complications, and fluoroscopy and procedure times. The ablation outcomes were excellent and comparable in all four types of the arrhythmias between the two techniques. Major complications included one cardiac tamponade in each group and one second-degree AV block in the conventional group. Fluoroscopy time was shorter using the CARTO technique: 10+/-7 versus 27+/-15 minutes for AVNRT (P < 0.01), 18+/-17 versus 44+/-23 minutes for atrial tachycardia and flutter (P < 0.01), 15+/-12 versus 34+/-31 minutes for VT (P < 0.05), and 21+/-14 versus 53+/-32 minutes for bypass tract tachycardia (P < 0.01). Procedure times were similar except for the bypass tract patients, which was shorter in the CARTO group, 4+/-1.3 versus 5.5+/-2.5 hours (P < 0.01).\par
  {\em CONCLUSION:} The electroanatomic three-dimensional mapping technique reduced fluoroscopy time and resulted in excellent outcome without increasing the procedure time.},

  abstract  = {{\em INTRODUCTION:} The ``critical point hypothesis'' for induction of ventricular fibrillation has previously been extended to infer the coexistence of four critical points, and hence four simultaneous spiral reentries or a quatrefoil reentry, resulting from only one premature stimulus delivered to the same location as the pacing stimulus. An optical imaging technique was used to explore its existence and to study the induction mechanism of this peculiar reentry pattern.\par
  {\em METHODS AND RESULTS:} In 16 isolated, Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts, high-speed optical imaging at 133 or 267 frames/sec was performed to observe the induced response with a unipolar point electrode. A novel quatrefoil-shaped reentry pattern consisting of two pairs of opposing rotors was created by delivering long stimuli during the vulnerable phase. Successful induction occurred in a narrow range of coupling intervals. A dogbone pattern of virtual electrodes was established during the premature stimulus. Propagating wavefronts launched from the virtual anodes immediately after the termination of S2. The alternating blocking and conducting effects of the virtual electrodes, as well as the boundary between virtual cathode and virtual anode, provided the necessary pathways for quatrefoil reentry. Propagation directions of the reentrant spiral wavefronts reversed with a reversal in S2 polarity. Quatrefoil reentries were not sustained and lasted 1 to 4 complete cycles.\par
  {\em CONCLUSION:} The initiation of quatrefoil reentry followed anodal- or cathodal-break stimulation as a result of local symmetrical enhancement of the dispersion of tissue excitability. The ``critical point hypothesis'' provides the minimum topology required for this type of reentry; the ``graded response hypothesis'' can be viewed as providing a more detailed explanation of how this topology is actually realized. Triggering mechanisms due to the ``break'' mode of stimulation also posits a new mechanism for defibrillation.},

  abstract  = {INTRODUCTION: Mapping endocardial activation and repolarization processes is critical to the study of arrhythmias and selection of therapeutic procedures. Previously, we developed methodology for reconstructing endocardial potentials from potentials measured with a noncontact, intracavitary probe. This study further develops and evaluates the ability of the approach to provide detailed information on the spatiotemporal characteristics of the activation process. Specifically, we reconstructed endocardial electrograms and isochrones throughout the activation process over the entire endocardium during a single beat.\par
  METHODS AND RESULTS: Cavity potentials were measured with a 65-electrode probe placed inside an isolated canine left ventricle. Endocardial potentials were measured simultaneously using 52 electrodes. Potentials were acquired during subendocardial pacing from different locations. Computed electrograms at various sites closely resemble the measured electrograms (correlation coefficient > 0.9 at 60% of the electrodes). Computed isochrones locate subendocardial pacing sites with 10-mm accuracy. Two pacing sites, 17 mm apart, were resolved. Critical regions, such as areas of isochrone crowding, were accurately reconstructed.\par
  CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate the applicability of the approach to mapping the cardiac excitation process on a beat-by-beat basis without occluding the ventricle. The ability of locating electrical events (e.g., single or multiple initiation sites) is demonstrated. Importantly, the method is shown to be capable of reconstructing electrograms over the entire endocardium and determining nonuniformities of activation spread (e.g., areas of slow conduction). These capabilities are important to clinical application in the electrophysiology laboratory and experimental studies of arrhythmias in the intact animal.},

The boundary element method was used to discretize the relationship between the body surface potentials and epicardial cage potentials. Variants of Tikhonov regularization were used to stabilize the inversion of the body surface potentials in order to reconstruct the epicardial surface potentials. The computational issues investigated were (1) computation of the regularization parameter; (2) effects of inaccuracy in locating the position of the heart; and (3) incorporation of a priori information on the properties of epicardial potentials into the regularization methodology. Two methods were suggested by which a priori information could be incorporated into the regularization formulation: (1) use of an estimate of the epicardial potential distribution everywhere on the surface and (2) use of regional bounds on the excursion of the potential. Results indicate that the a posteriori technique called CRESO, developed by Colli Franzone and coworkers, most consistently derives the regularization parameter closest to the optimal parameter for this experimental situation. The sensitivity of the inverse computation in a realistic-geometry torso to inaccuracies in estimating heart position are consistent with results from the eccentric spheres model; errors of 1 cm are well tolerated, but errors of 2 cm or greater result in a loss of position and amplitude information. Finally, estimates and bounds based on accurate, known information successfully lower the relative error associated with the inverse and have the potential to significantly enhance the amplitude and feature position information obtainable from the inverse-reconstructed epicardial potential map.},

  abstract  = {In most early studies of cardiac electrophysiology, the correlation between propagation of excitation and the architecture of cardiac fibers was not addressed. More recently, it has become apparent that the spread of excitation, the sequence of recovery, the associated time-varying potential distributions and the intra- and extracardiac electrocardiograms are strongly affected by the complex orientation of myocardial fibers. This article is a review of older and very recent, partly unpublished, mathematical simulations and experimental findings that document the relationships between cardiac electrophysiology and fiber structure. Important anatomical factors that affect propagation and recovery are: the elongated shape of myocardial fibers which is the basis for electrical anisotropy; the epi-endocardial rotation of fiber direction in the ventricular walls; the epi-endocardial obliqueness of the fibers (``imbrication angle''), and the conduction system. Due to the complex architecture of the fibers, many different pathways are available to an excitation wavefront as it spreads from a pacing site: the straight line; the multiple, bent pathways resulting from the epi-endocardial rotation of fiber direction; the coiling intramural pathways associated with the ``imbrication'' angles (Streeter) and the pathways involving the Purkinje network. Only in a few cases is the straight line the fastest pathway. The shape of an excitation wavefront at a given time instant results from the competition between all possible pathways. To compute the potential distributions and ECG waveforms generated by a spreading excitation wave we must know the successive shapes and positions of the wavefront, the architecture of the fibers through which it propagates and the spatial distribution of their anisotropic electrical properties.},

  abstract  = {Body surface potential maps (BSMs) depict the time varying distribution of cardiac potentials on the entire surface of the torso. Hundreds of studies have shown that BSMs contain more diagnostic and prognostic information than can be elicited from the 12-lead ECG. Despite these advantages, body surface mapping has not become a routinely used clinical method. One reason is that visual examination and sophisticated analysis of BSMs do not permit inferring the sequence of excitation and repolarization in the heart with a sufficient degree of certainty and detail. These limitations can be partially overcome by implementing inverse procedures that reconstruct epicardial potentials, isochrones, and ECGs from body surface measurements. Furthermore, ongoing experimental work and simulation studies show that a great deal of information about intramural events can be elicited from measured or reconstructed epicardial potential distributions. Interpreting epicardial data in terms of deep activity requires extensive knowledge of the architecture of myocardial fibers, their anisotropic properties, and the role of rotational anisotropy in affecting propagation and the associated potential fields.},

  abstract  = {{\em INTRODUCTION:} For many decades, the interpretation of unipolar electrograms (EGs) and ECGs was based on simple models of the heart as a current generator, e.g., the uniform dipole layer, and, more recently, the ``oblique dipole layer.'' However, a number of recent and old experimental data are inconsistent with the predictions of these models. To address this problem, we implemented a numerical model simulating the spread of excitation through a parallelepipedal myocardial slab, with a view to identifying the factors that affect the shape, amplitude, and polarity of unipolar EGs generated by the spreading wavefront.\par
  {\em METHODS AND RESULTS:} The numerical model represents a portion of the left ventricular wall as a parallelepipedal slab (6.5 x 6.5 x 1 cm); the myocardial tissue is represented as an anisotropic bidomain with epi-endocardial rotation of fiber direction and unequal anisotropy ratio. Following point stimulation, excitation times in the entire volume are computed by using an eikonal formulation. Potential distributions are computed by assigning a fixed shape to the action potential profile. EGs at multiple sites in the volume are computed from the time varying potential distributions. The simulations show that the unipolar QRS waveforms are the sum of a ``field'' component, representing the effect of an approaching or receding wavefront on the potential recorded by a unipolar electrode, and a previously unrecognized ``reference'' component, which reflects the drift, during the spread of excitation, of the reference potential, which moves from near the positive to near the negative extreme of the potential distribution during the spread of excitation.\par
  {\em CONCLUSION:} The drift of the reference potential explains the inconsistencies between the predictions of the models and the actual shapes of the EGs. The drift modifies the slopes of EG waveforms during excitation and recovery and can be expected to affect the assessment of excitation and recovery times and QRS and ST-T areas. Removing the drift reestablishes consistency between potential distributions and electrographic waveforms.},

We then compare this formulation of GES with zero order Tikhonov regularization on data collected from a swine experiment with the swine heart paced from six different sites. Although the inverse problems are solved at each time instant independently, we also incorporate temporal information by moving average filtering the estimates, and this is more effective for the GES methods than for Tikhonov.},

All these methods are based on the analysis of the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix related to the observed data. By using artificial multilead ECGs in which the properties of the signal and noise parts were known, the effect of taking into account these properties was investigated. It was found that the method based on information-theoretic criteria was superior in detecting the number of signal components, in the case that the noise in the data is non-white, as compared to a simple threshold method.},

  abstract  = {Three different methods to detect the number of independent signals in multilead ECGs were evaluated by using different ECG realizations with known specifications for signal and noise: a threshold method (TM), the minimum description length (MDL) and Akaike's information criterion (AIC). The fundamental assumption in this kind of signal processing is that both the signal and the noise stem from independent stochastic generators. The consequence is that the detection of the number of signals is only possible if the noise is white, or if the noise properties have been specified. The evaluation was performed with respect to the QRS complex of individual multilead ECG simulations and to the entire ensemble. In the simulated ECGs the number of independent signals was fixed (eight). It was found that, out of the three methods studied, the performance of MDL was the best, especially when the number of available observations in the noise (used to estimate the noise specifications) was moderate.},

It is claimed that the Forward-Problem of electrocardiography is no longer a problem. Several source models of cardiac electrical activity are considered, one of which can be directly interpreted in terms of the underlying electrophysiology (the depolarization sequence of the ventricles). The importance of using tailored rather than textbook geometry in inverse procedures is stressed.},

To illustrate these results, the electric potentials in an anisotropic finite length cylinder and in an anisotropic volume conductor of irregular (torso) shape, computed by the boundary element method, are compared with the results obtained by the analytical solution and the finite element method, respectively.},
