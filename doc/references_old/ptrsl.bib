  abstract  = {The recently completed draft sequence of the human genome provides access to a vast database of information, containing of the order of 30 000-40 000 genes. These are understood to encode some 250 000 proteins. Understanding how the information in the genome is used to create this 'proteome' is a major challenge, not least because predicting the functionally important three-dimensional structure of proteins from their amino-acid sequences is very difficult. But even these formidable challenges pale into insignificance when we consider the complexity of the next stage: understanding the interactions of tens of thousands of proteins as they generate biological function. This is the task of quantitative analysis of physiological function, which in its entirety is now referred to as the `physiome'. Bioinformatics and computational cell and organ modelling will play an increasingly important role in all these stages of unravelling the way in which the information contained in the genome is `computed' to create living systems. Here, we address all but a small fragment of the physiome project: the development of integrative models of the heart.},

  abstract  = {The simple sustainable or `eternal' cell model, assuming preservation of all proteins, is designed as a building block, a primitive element upon which one can build more complete functional cell models of various types, representing various species. In the modelling we emphasize the electrophysiological aspects, in part because these are a well-developed component of cell models and because membrane potentials and their fluctuations have been generally omitted from metabolically oriented cell models in the past. Fluctuations in membrane potential deserve heightened consideration because probably all cells have negative intracellular potentials and most cells demonstrate electrical activity with vesicular extrusion, receptor occupancy, as well as with stimulated excitation resulting in regenerative depolarization. The emphasis is on the balances of mass, charge, and of chemical species while accounting for substrate uptake, metabolism and metabolite loss from the cell. By starting with a primitive representation we emphasize the conservation ideas. As more advanced models are generated they must adhere to the same basic principles as are required for the most primitive incomplete model.},

Processing applications are able to appropriately render models based on the definition of model structure given in a CellML document, and run simulations based on the definition of the underlying mathematics. CellML is designed to be a general framework upon which a wide variety of models may be built. The basic constituents and structure are simple, providing a common basis for describing models and facilitating the creation of complex models from simpler ones by combining models and/or adding detail to existing models. CellML models are represented as a collection of discrete components linked by connections to form a network. A component is a functional unit that may correspond to a physical compartment, a collection of entities engaged in similar tasks, or a convenient modelling abstraction. Components may contain variables, mathematical relationships that specify the interactions between those variables, and metadata. Variables may be local to a component, or made visible to other components via interface attributes. All interactions between variables within a component are described using MathML content markup. The interface attributes describe the external view of the component, specifying those variables visible to other components. A connection is a directed mapping from externally visible variables in one component to those of another. Every variable has a set of units associated with it, making it possible to connect together components with variables defined using different units. CellML offers additional facilities, such as metadata, for adding context information to a model, and component grouping. These assist in the creation and maintenance of models but do not alter the mathematics of the model. All models described using CellML can be reduced to the canonical form: a set of connected components.},

In mammalian sinoatrial node, reduction or abolition of the intracellular \ionCa transient by ryanodine, sarcoplasmic reticulum \ionCa pump block or 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N, N, N', N'-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA) reduces the spontaneous rate by 21-32%, whereas in amphibian sinus venosus it abolishes spontaneous activity. In rabbit sinoatrial node, ryanodine/BAPTA reduces the T-type \ionCa current (\i{Ca,T}), perhaps slows inactivation of the L-type \ionCa current (\i{Ca,L}), reduces the inward \ionNa-\ionCa exchange current (\i{NaCa}), and reduces the rapid and slow delayed rectifier \ionK currents (\i{K,r} and \i{K,s}, respectively). Other evidence shows that a reduction of intracellular \ionCa inhibits the hyperpolarization-activated current (\i{f}). These putative intracellular \ionCa-dependent changes in ionic currents have been incorporated into different models of rabbit sinoatrial node action potentials. In the models, block of the \ionCa transient reduced the spontaneous rate by 24 and 26% in the central and peripheral models of Zhang and others, 13% in the Oxsoft model (Noble et al.), 9% in the model of Wilders and others, and 41% in the model of Demir and others. In all models, the reduction in rate was not primarily the result of the decrease in \i{NaCa}, but instead the combination of all changes in ionic currents.},

  abstract  = {Two independent mathematical models of the electrophysiology of the human atrial cell have been published. Although these two models are based on very similar data, they can result in some apparently contradictory findings, some of which are of fundamental importance to human atrial electrophysiology and pharmacology. In particular, simulations with these two models have given rise to different conclusions regarding the role of the rapidly activating sustained outward \ionK current, \I{sus}, in determining the action-potential duration. Different conclusions regarding the rate dependence of the action potential have also been published. In this paper, we review and compare these two models in an attempt to determine the reasons for these discrepancies. The individual ion current characterizations are quite similar in the two models. The primary difference between the models is in the assumed baseline action potential shape, and therefore the sizes of the underlying ionic currents. The duration of spike-and-dome-type action potentials, which rely mainly on the delayed rectifier currents, \I{Kr} and \I{Ks}, for final repolarization, is relatively insensitive to block of \I{sus}. In contrast, triangular action potentials are prolonged substantially by \I{sus} block, since they rely more on \I{sus} for final repolarization. The rate-dependent properties of spike-and-dome action potentials can be explained in terms of their larger \I{CaL} (L-type calcium current), \I{Kr} and \I{Ks} currents.},

In addition to purely single entities, the review covers other models that have attempted to capture the highly interactive and complex Ca signalling resulting from the interplay of the key components above. These integrative models range in level from microscopic domains to whole cells including electrophysiological mechanisms. In many cases, the differences in competing models reflect the controversies and uncertainties about the underlying biophysical mechanisms.

These same studies have also shown altered expression of calcium-handling proteins, specifically down regulation of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) \ionCa-ATPase, and up regulation of the \ionNa-\ionCa exchanger. We have tested the hypothesis that this minimal model of end-stage HF can account for action potential (AP) prolongation, and reduced \ionCa  transient amplitude and decay rate observed in failing myocytes. To do this, we have developed a computer model of the normal and failing canine myocyte that describes properties of both membrane currents as well as intracellular calcium cycling. Model simulations closely reproduce AP and \ionCa transient properties measured experimentally in failing myocytes. Simulations also indicate that the predominant mechanism of AP prolongation in canine HF is reduction of \ionCa-dependent inactivation of L-type \ionCa current in response to reduced SR \ionCa levels. These reduced SR \ionCa levels are, in turn, a consequence of HF-induced down regulation of the SR \ionCa-ATPase, and up regulation of the \ionNa-\ionCa exchanger. The hypothesis that intracellular \ionCa cycling has important influences on AP duration changes in HF is supported by a measured close correlation between AP duration and \ionCa transient amplitude when myocytes are stimulated from rest.},

Epicardial and M cells, but not endocardial cells, display action potentials with a notched or spike-and-dome morphology: the result of a prominent, transient, outward current-mediated phase 1. M cells are distinguished from endocardial and epicardial cells by the ability of their action potential to disproportionately prolong in response to a slowing down of rate and/or in response to agents with class III actions. This intrinsic electrical heterogeneity contributes to the inscription of the electrocardiogram (ECG) as well as to the development of a variety of cardiac arrhythmias. Heterogeneous response of the three cell types to pharmacological agents and/or pathophysiological states results in amplification of intrinsic electrical heterogeneities, thus providing a substrate as well as a trigger for the development of re-entrant arrhythmias, including Torsade de Pointes, commonly associated with the long-QT syndrome (LQTS), and the polymorphic ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation (VT/VF) encountered in the Brugada syndrome. Despite an abundance of experimental data describing the heterogeneity of cellular electrophysiology that exists across the ventricular wall, relatively few computer models have been developed to investigate the physiological and pathophysiological consequences of such electrical heterogeneity. As computer power increases and numerical algorithms improve, three-dimensional computer models of ventricular conduction that combine physiological membrane kinetics with realistic descriptions of myocardial structure and geometry will become more feasible. With sufficient detail and accuracy, these models should illuminate the complex mechanisms underlying the initiation and maintenance of Torsade de Pointes and other arrhythmias.},

It is well established that ventricular fibrillation is a result of turbulent propagation of the electrical excitation wave. However, despite more than a century of investigation, the precise mechanism of its initiation and maintenance remains largely unknown. Novel experimental tools for the visualization of the excitation wave as well as advanced three-dimensional computer models of the heart, which have become available in recent years, have intensified attempts to solve the puzzle of ventricular fibrillation. These efforts have revealed significantly different manifestations of ventricular fibrillation, suggesting that multiple mechanisms are responsible for this arrhythmia. Several new hypotheses have been put forward recently that deviate considerably from Moe's standard hypothesis of fibrillation, which has dominated the field for almost four decades. One of the hypotheses that has been most actively discussed is the spiral-breakup (also called the restitution) hypothesis. This hypothesis may lead to a breakthrough in our understanding of the factors that cause this deadly arrhythmia and provide a constructive approach to the development of efficient antifibrillatory drugs.},
