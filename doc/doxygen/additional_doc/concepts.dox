\page basis Basis Functions
Basis functions are the key item to specify the field approximation/interpolation and the linking of nodes and elements to form a mesh.
Currently, it has two types: Lagrange-Hermite tensor product and Simplex.
Lagrange-Hermite tensor product can be further divided into linear to cubic lagrange, cubic and quadratic hermite. 
It can be arbitrarily collapsed (two or more nodes in the same location) in any one direction or in any two directions to give a degenerate basis.
Simplex basic functions could contain line, triangular and tetrahedral elements. 
It could be linear, quadratic or cubic.
Arbitrary Gaussian quadrature can integrate from 1st to 5th order (3rd  order for lines at the moment).
Can only have the same order in each direction at the moment.
Specifying a basis function automatically generates all necessary line and face basis functions as sub-bases of the basis function.

- User number
- Global number
- Family number
- Finished tag
- Type
- Is Hermite
- Number of XI
- Number of XI coordinates

It anchors the regions within the real world. 
Coordinate system can have different types such as:

\page regions Regions
Regions are one of the primary objects in openCMISS. 
Regions are hierarchical in nature in that a region can have one parent region and a number of daughter sub-regions. 
Daughter regions are related in space to parent regions by an origin and an orientation of the regions coordinate system.
Daughter regions may only have the same or fewer dimensions as the parent region.
There is a global (world) region (number 0) that has the global (world) coordinate system.

Equations sets are aimed to have multiple classes,

Different equations are within each class, e.g. Bidomain, Navier-stokes etc.
Each equation can use different solution techniques, e.g. FEM, BEM, FD, GFEM.
The equation set is associated with a region and is built using the fields defined on the region.      

The numerical methods are used which will result in a discretised matrix-vector form of the governing equations.
openCMISS is designed to generate equations sets with a number of "equations" matrices.
